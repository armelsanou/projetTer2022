 any other  symptoms  or problems that you notice with the muscle aches  
 are there other people sick as you at home with your same  symptoms   
 are you having any other  symptoms   
 are you having any shortness of breath  
 are you still having the chest pain 
 because this is  flu  season 
 but also we shouldn 't be put aside for the heart cardiac origin chest pain 
 but a more important problem now is this chest pain 
 but i have  difficulty breathing  
 but i know lot of people  cough  on me 
 but we need to treat every chest pain with the utmost seriousness 
 but you 're  breathing  all right right now right  
 cause of this chest pain i totally forgot 
 does it feel like somebody squeezing your chest 
 do still feel like shortness of breath 
 do they complain of being sick similar  symptoms   
 do you have any other chronic like high  blood pressure  or anything like that  
 do you have any other diseases chronic medical problems like  diabetes   
 do you have any shortness of breath with that chest pain  
 do you have high  blood pressure   
 do you have some shortness of breath goes with that  
 do you know what  symptoms  she was having  
 do you see the image  
 drink plenty of fluids today 
 however i take tests for the  diabetes  
 however she has  symptoms  quite similar to mine

 I had a  fever  yesterday 
 I have a sharp pain here in the chest 
 I have some  difficulty breathing  too 
 I 'll send you an image 
 I 'm having some chest pain today 
 I 'm just having some headaches and some  fever  today 
 in my opinion it is  flu  
 in my opinion this is a little  flu  
 is it like some heavy heavy person sitting on your chest  
 it all started with the headaches and with the  fever  about the same time 
 it hurts in the middle of my chest 
 it is a pressure like chest pain 
 it is in my chest 
 it is in the center of my chest 
 it is in the center of the chest 
 I 've got pain in my chest 
 I 've very concerned of this chest pain 
 I want you to tell me in describing this chest pain 
 like high  blood pressure  or  diabetes  
 like right in the center of the chest 
 now for the  fever  you can take a tachipirina sweet 
 now mary how many days have you had the  symptoms  
 now you said you have a chest pain 
 occasionally i have some chest pain 
 okay are you having any other  symptoms  along with this other than just the pain 
 or somebody sitting on your chest  
 pretty much the same with the  fever  and the  cough  headache and muscle pains 
 right in the middle of my chest 
 show me on this image where you feel the pain 
 since you have a  fever  
 so do you think that some of these  symptoms  could be related to being pregnant  
 so your children are having some of the same  symptoms   
 tell me about your chest pain 
 the  fever  increases at night 
 the  fever  i 've had for the last two days 
 the  fever  started to increase last night 
 this is doctor porter in the emergency room triage center

 rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of  Coronavirus disease   COVID-19  in the European Union  European Economic Area and the United Kingdom  1 January to 15 March 2020 
 the cumulative incidence of  Coronavirus disease   COVID-19  cases is showing similar trends in European Union  European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that  while at a different stage depending on the country  the  COVID-19 pandemic  is progressing rapidly in all countries  
 based on the experience from Italy  countries  hospitals and intensive care units should increase their  preparedness  for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare  and in particular intensive care  
 on 31 December 2019  a cluster of  pneumonia  cases of unknown aetiology was reported in  Wuhan    Hubei  Province  China  
 on 9 January 2020  the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the  causative agent  as being a  novel Coronavirus  now referred to as severe acute  respiratory syndrome   Coronavirus  2   SARS-CoV-2    
 since  the  illness  resulting from  SARS-CoV-2   infection  has been named  Coronavirus disease   COVID-19   
 evidence to date is that ca 80  of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild disease  ie a  respiratory  tract  infection  with or without  pneumonia   and most of these recover  
 in ca 14  cases  COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalisation while the remaining 6  cases experience critical  illness  requiring intensive care  
 the mortality of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 is ca 4   
 in this study  we assess the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union  European Economic Area  EU  EEA  country and the United Kingdom  UK  and compare them to that of  Hubei  Province  China  
 we also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU  EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy during 31 January – 15 March 2020  
 COVID-19 cases in EU  EEA countries and the UK 
 subsequent to China  COVID-19 underwent further geographical  spread  and the dynamic of the  COVID-19 pandemic  in the rest of the world currently follows that of this country  
 on 11 March 2020  the Director General of the  World Health Organization    WHO   declared COVID-19 a  pandemic   
 in the 5 March issue of Eurosurveillance 2020  Spiteri et al reported on the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the  WHO  case definition  
 in the EU  EEA  the first three  confirmed cases  were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from  Wuhan    Hubei  Province  China  
 as at 15 March 2020  COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU  EEA countries and the United Kingdom  UK   whereby between 31 December 2019 and that date included  39768 cases and 1727  deaths  had been reported  with 17750 cases and 1441  deaths  from Italy alone  
 obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases 
 at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control  ECDC   the notified COVID-19 case counts in each country worldwide  obtained from only official sources such as the countries ’ Ministry of Health  national and regional health authorities and the  WHO   are updated each day at 8  00 am  
 these data were used for assessing the trends of COVID-19 in EU  EEA and the UK  and comparing them to that in Italy  
 as a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases  we calculated the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases  thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19  in each EU  EEA country and the UK  during the 1 January – 15 March 2020 period  
 we also presented the cumulative number of notified cases of each country as at 15 March 2020 8  00 am compared with that of Italy for the 31 January – 15 March 2020 period  
 trends of COVID-19 in EU  EEA countries and the UK 
 the trends in the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU  EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of  Hubei  Province  China   Figure 1   
 for the EU  EEA and the UK overall  the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020  Supplementary material   
 this was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy  but all other EU  EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19  Supplementary material   
 figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases  in EU  EEA countries and the UK compared with that in Italy for the 31 January – 15 March 2020 period  
 it highlights that  as at 15 March 8  00 am  15 other EU  EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy just 3 weeks prior or less  
 our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU  EEA and the UK  
 the observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the  pandemic  is progressing at a comparable speed in all countries  
 this is despite countries being at different stages  variations in national public health responses  and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19  including catch-up testing  
 early March 2020  doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which ca 10  of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity  
 data on admission of COVID-19 cases in a hospital and  or an intensive care unit are currently available at EU  EEA level for only 6  and 1  cases  respectively  data not shown   
 they should  however  be collected in a systematic fashion to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of  deaths   
 a study performed in 2010 – 11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe  ranging from 292 in Germany to 42 beds per 100000 population in Portugal  
 this means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy  125 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100000 population in 2010 – 11   
 modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation  with estimates for each EU  EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with a > 90  risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity  are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC  rapid risk assessment  on COVID-19  
 since cases have so far clustered in certain regions in EU  EEA countries and the UK  and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional catchment population  information about cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2  NUTS-2  level  
 the experience from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the  COVID-19 pandemic  is progressing rapidly in the EU  EEA and the UK  
 countries  hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained  community transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare  and in particular intensive care  such as the one occurring in the affected regions of Italy  
 as pointed out in the recent ECDC  rapid risk assessment   a rapid  proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the  spread  of SARS-COV-2  with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach  as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to comprehend  accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time  
 the  rapid risk assessment  also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the  pandemic   
 there is a short window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow down the  spread  of  SARS-CoV-2  and decrease the pressure on healthcare  
 failing this  it is likely that the healthcare systems of other EU  EEA countries will face a surge of patients that require intensive care within the coming days or weeks  




 the  outbreak  of  Coronavirus  disease 2019  COVID-19   caused by severe acute  respiratory syndrome    SARS    Coronavirus  2   SARS-CoV-2    has thus far killed over 3000 people and  infected  over 80000 in China and elsewhere in the world  resulting in catastrophe for humans  
 similar to its homologous  virus    SARS-CoV   which caused  SARS  in thousands of people in 2003   SARS-CoV-2  might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar  symptoms  through a similar mechanism  
 however  COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than  SARS  but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women  
 in response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease  this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject  
 we will cover the basics about the epidemiology  etiology  virology  diagnosis  treatment   prognosis   and prevention of the disease  
 although many questions still require answers  we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease  
 the Spring Festival on January 25  2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory to all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors for all the holiday and for many weeks after due to the outbreak of a novel viral disease  
 the  virus  is highly homologous to the  Coronavirus   COV  that caused an  outbreak  of severe acute  respiratory syndrome    SARS   in 2003  thus  it was named  SARS-CoV-2  by the  World Health Organization    WHO   on February 11  2020  and the associated disease was named COV Disease-19  COVID-19   
 the  epidemic  started in  Wuhan   China  and quickly  spread  throughout the entire country and to near 50 others all over the world  
 as of March 2  2020  the  virus  has resulted in over 80000  confirmed cases  of COVID-19  with more than 40000 patients discharged and over 3000 patients who died  
 who warns that COVID-19 is “ public enemy number 1 ” and potentially more powerful than terrorism  
 according to PubMed  https    wwwncbinlmnihgov  PUBMED    in less than two months  over 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 including its virology  epidemiology  etiology  diagnosis  and treatment since the first report on January 7  2020 that determined the sequence of the  virus  isolated from multiple patients  
 this review attempts to summarize the research progress in the new and swiftly developing subject area  
 whenever possible  we will try to compare COVID-19 with  SARS  and another CoV-caused disease  Middle East  respiratory syndrome   MERS  an  outbreak  in 2012   
 we will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding the prevention and  prognosis  of the disease as well as some remaining yet urgent questions  
 CoVs have been traditionally considered nonlethal  pathogens  to humans  mainly causing approximately 15  of  common colds  4  
 however  in this century  we have encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs twice  ie   SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV  which caused an  outbreak  originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012  respectively  and soon  spread  to many other countries with horrible morbidity and mortality  
 therefore  the current COVID-19 is the third COV  outbreak  in the recorded history of humans  
 as shown in Fig  ​ Fig11  clusters of  pneumonia  that had unknown origins were first reported from  Wuhan  on December 31  2019 to the China National Health Commission  
 seven days later the sequence of the COV was released  
 on January 15  2020 the first fatal case from  Wuhan  was reported  
 meanwhile  the  epidemic  rapidly  spread  to the neighboring cities  provinces  and countries  
 on January 20  the infection of health-care providers was reported  suggesting that human-to-human  transmission  was possible  
 on January 23  the city of  Wuhan  was locked down with all its public transportation stopped  
 on January 24 the first clinical study on the disease reported that  out of 41 patients with  confirmed cases   only 21 had direct contact with the  Wuhan  seafood market that was considered the starting site of the  infection  from an unknown animal source  
 on January 30   WHO  declared the  outbreak  a  global health emergency   
 by the time of this report  the disease has already  spread  throughout China and near 50 other countries all over the world  Fig  ​  Fig2  2   
 as the situation is rapidly evolving  the final scope and severity of the  outbreak  remain to be determined  
 on February 11  2020  a multi-center study on 8866 patients including 4021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a more updated illustration of the  epidemic  as follows  https    mpweixinqqcom  s  UlBi-HX _ rHPXa1qHA2bhdA   
  SARS-CoV-2   infected  people of all ages  but mainly at the age of 30-65  
 almost half  477   of the  infected  individuals were over 50 years old  very few were under 20  and only 14 infected individuals were under the age of 10  
  SARS-CoV-2   infected  more men  031  100000  than women  027  100000   
 COVID-19 expanded in clusters mainly in and around  Hubei   
 COVID-19 took an average of 5  2-9  days from  onset  to diagnosis  
 the average  incubation period  was 48  30-72  days  
 the average time from  onset  to death was 95  48-13  days  
 the basic reproductive number  R0  was 377  95  CI  351-405   and the adjusted R0 was 223-482  
 the number of  infected  people increased exponentially before 23 Jan 2020  matching the time of massive transportation before the Spring Festival in China  
 the mortality of patients with  confirmed cases  was 144   95  CI  110-186    and the adjusted mortality of all the patients was 306   95  CI  202-459    
 three major risk factors for COVID-19 were sex  male   age  ≥ 60   and severe  pneumonia   
 CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses containing a single strand of sense  RNA   
 they can be divided into four genera  ie  alpha  beta  gamma  and delta  of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to  infect  humans  
 the envelope spike  S  glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING enzyme 2  ACE2  and dipeptidyl peptidase 4  DPP4  for  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV  respectively  and then membrane fusion occurs  
 the viral  RNA  genome is released into the cytoplasm  after replication of the viral genome  genomic  RNA  accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms virion-containing vesicles  which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the  virus   
 the first genomic sequence of  SARS-CoV-2  was reported on January 10  2020  
  SARS-CoV-2  was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 9998  genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the  outbreak   the Huanan Seafood Market in  Wuhan   
  SARS-CoV-2  is genetically more similar to  SARS-CoV  than to MERS-CoV  
 through  transmission  electron microscopy   SARS-CoV-2  particles were found in ultrathin sections of human airway epithelium  
 human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for  SARS-CoV-2  as well as  SARS-CoV   
 however  the S protein of  SARS-CoV-2  binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of  SARS-CoV   which is coincident with the fact that  SARS-CoV-2  causes less severe  infection  in patients than  SARS-CoV   
  SARS-CoV-2  can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8  
 the orf3b of  SARS-CoV-2  may play a role in the viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ  however  orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif  
 on February 18  2020  Zhou  et al   reported the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 29 Å resolution in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1  
 they found that the complex  which had open and closed conformations  was assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins  which provides evidence for COV recognition and  infection   
 B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress  SARS-CoV-2   infection   
 the origin and  intermediate host  
 it has been known that both  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet cats and camels  respectively  
 through a phylogenetic comparison of  SARS-CoV-2  with other CoVs  bats were considered the native host of  SARS-CoV-2  as the new  virus  is 96  identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21  
 however  what  intermediate host  helped the  virus  cross the species barrier to  infect  humans remains unknown  and the  transmission  route is yet to be elucidated  
 Ji  et al   proposed snakes as a carrier of the  virus  from bats to humans which involved homologous recombination within the S protein  
 according to a study  researchers in Guangzhou  China  suggested that  pangolins  - long-snouted  ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential  intermediate host  of  SARS-CoV-2  based on 99  genetic homology in a COV discovered in pangolins and  SARS-CoV-2   
 however  1  difference spread all over two genomes is still a big difference  thus  conclusive results for concrete evidence are awaited  Fig  ​  Fig33   
 the physicochemical properties of  SARS-CoV-2  are largely not yet known  
  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 ° C and 40  -50  humidity  
  SARS-CoV-2  may possess similar properties  
 it has been reported that  SARS-CoV-2  is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 ° C for 30 minutes  ether  75  ethanol  chlorine-containing  disinfectant   peracetic acid  chloroform  and other fatty solvents  but not chlorhexidine  can effectively inactivate the  virus   
 the entire human population generally lacks  immunity  to  SARS-CoV-2  and hence is susceptible to the  novel virus   
 currently  no detailed study has been reported regarding the immunological response to  SARS-CoV-2   
 thus  we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs  especially  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV  Fig  ​  Fig4  4   
 in general  after a  virus  invades the host  it is first recognized by the host innate  immune system  through pattern recognition receptors  PRRS  including C-type lectin-like receptors  Toll-like receptor  TLR   NOD-like receptor  NLR   and RIG-I-like receptor  RLR   
 through different pathways  the  virus  induces the expression of inflammatory factors  maturation of dendritic cells  and synthesis of type I interferons  IFNs  which limit the  spreading  of the  virus  and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens  
 however  the N protein of  SARS-CoV  can help the  virus  escape from the immune responses  
 soon  the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the  virus   
 t lymphocytes including CD4  and CD8  T cells play an important role in the defense  
 CD4  T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies  and CD8  T cells directly kill virus-infected cells  
 t helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells  
 however  COV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing apoptosis of T cells  
 the humoral  immunity  including complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also essential in combating the  viral infection   
 for example  antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV  
 on the other hand  an overreaction of the  immune system  generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damages to the  lungs  and other organs  and  in the worst scenario   multi-organ failure  and even death  
 the  SARS-CoV-2   infection   featured by clustering onset  is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women  
 it is common that for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised  they have higher chance to  be infected  than others  
 the estimated mean  incubation period  of  SARS-CoV-2  is 1-14 days  mostly 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in  Wuhan   
 however  a study on 1099 cases demonstrates that  the incubation period  was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days  
 a more recent study  as described above  demonstrates that the  incubation period  was 48  30-72  days based on the demography of 8866 cases  
 it is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective  quarantine  time based on the most accurate  incubation period   thus preventing  infected  but symptomless people from transmitting the  virus  to others  
 as a common practice  individuals exposed to  or  infected  by  the  virus  are usually required to be  quarantined  for 14 days  
 should the  quarantine  time be extended to 24 days  
  fever  is often the major and initial  symptom  of COVID-19  which can be accompanied by no symptom or other symptoms such as  dry cough    shortness of breath   muscle ache  dizziness  headache   sore throat   rhinorrhea  chest pain  diarrhea  nausea  and vomiting  
 some patients experienced dyspnea and  or hypoxemia one week after the  onset  of the disease  
 in severe cases  patients quickly progressed to develop acute  respiratory syndrome    septic shock   metabolic acidosis  and coagulopathy  
 patients with  fever  and  or  respiratory   symptoms  and acute  fever   even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities  should be screened for the  virus  for early diagnosis  
 a demographic study in late December of 2019 showed that the percentages of the  symptoms  were 98  for  fever   76  for  dry cough   55  for dyspnea  and 3  for diarrhea  8  of the patients required  ventilation  support  
 similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by  transmission  from an  asymptomatic  individual  
 comparably  a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had  fever   98     dry cough   47    and dyspnea  55   as their main  symptoms   
 however  80  of them required  ventilation  support  much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the higher lethality of MERS than of COVID-19  
 diarrhea  26   and  sore throat   21   were also observed with MERS patients  
 in  SARS  patients  it has been demonstrated that  fever   99  -100     dry cough   29  -75    dyspnea  40  -42    diarrhea  20-25    and  sore throat   13-25   were the major  symptoms  and  ventilation  support was required for approximately 14  -20  of the patients  
 by February 14  the mortality of COVID-19 was 2  when the  confirmed cases  reached 66576 globally  
 comparably  the mortality of  SARS  by November 2002 was 10  of 8096  confirmed cases   
 for MERS  based on a demographic study in June 2012  the mortality was 37  of 2494  confirmed cases   
 an earlier study reported that the R0 of  SARS-CoV-2  was as high as 647 with a 95  confidence interval  CI  of 571-723  whereas the R0 of  SARS-CoV  only ranged from 2 to 4  
 a comparison of  SARS-CoV-2  with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding their  symptoms   mortality  and R0 is presented in Table ​ Table11  
 the above figures suggest that  SARS-CoV-2  has a higher ability to  spread  than MERS-CoV and  SARS-CoV   but it is less lethal than the latter two  
 thus  it is much more challenging to control the  epidemic  of  SARS-CoV-2  than those of MERS-CoV and  SARS-CoV   
 clustered onset often happens in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle such as a cruise ship  
 patients often have a history of travel or residence in  Wuhan  or other affected areas or contact with  infected  individuals or patients in the recent two weeks before the  onset   
 however  it has been reported that people can carry the  virus  without  symptoms  longer than two weeks and cured patients discharged from hospitals can carry the  virus  again  which sends out an alarm to increase the time for  quarantine   
 patients have normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells  especially lymphocytes  at the early stage  
 for example  lymphopenia with  white blood cell count  
 the levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients  and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients  
 in patients with severe cases  the level of D-dimer  a Fibrin degradation product present in the blood  was elevated  and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced  
 abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and featured by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the  lungs   
 patients often develop an atypical  pneumonia   acute lung injury  and  acute respiratory distress syndrome    ARDS    
 when  ARDS  happens  uncontrolled inflammation  fluid accumulation  and progressive fibrosis severely compromise the gas exchange  
 dysfunction of Type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases  surface  tension  thus reducing the ability of the  lungs  to expand and heightening the risk of lung collapse  
 therefore  the worst chest radiographic findings often parallel the most severe extent of the disease  
 on February 18  2020  the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes  hyaline membrane formation  and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration  and multinucleated syncytial cells in the  lungs  of a patient who died of the disease  consistent with the  pathology  of  viral infection  and  ARDS  and similar to that of  SARS  and MERS patients  
 the detection of  SARS-CoV-2   RNA  via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  was used as the major criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19  
 however  due to the high false-negative rate  which may accelerate the  epidemic   clinical manifestations started to be used for diagnosis  which no longer solely relied on RT-PCR  in China on February 13  2020  
 a similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of  SARS   
 therefore  a combination of disease history  clinical manifestations  laboratory tests  and radiological findings is essential and imperative for making an effective diagnosis  
 on February 14  2020  the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of using the CRISPR-based Sherlock technique to detect  SARS-CoV-2   which detects synthetic  SARS-CoV-2   RNA  fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol  L to 200 × 10-18 mol  L  10-100 copies per microliter of input  using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring elaborate instrumentation  
 hopefully  the new technique can dramatically enhance the sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples  
 due to the lack of experience with the novel COV  physicians can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients  while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other CoVs such as  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases  Table ​  Table2  2   
 these therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs  immunosuppressants  steroids  plasma from recovered patients  Chinese  medicine   and psychological support  
 even plasma from recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment  
 pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and  vaccines  against the  virus   
  SARS-CoV-2  mainly attacks the  lungs  in the beginning and probably also attacks  to a lesser degree  other organs that express ACE2  such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys  
 nevertheless   respiratory  dysfunction and failure are the major threat to the patients and the major cause of death  
 thus   respiratory  support is critical to relieve the  symptoms  and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy  high-flow oxygen  noninvasive  ventilation   and invasive  mechanical ventilation  depending on the severity of the disease  
 patients with severe  respiratory   symptoms  have to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ECMO   a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or  respiratory  failure  
 in addition  the maintenance of electrolyte balance  the prevention and treatment of secondary  infection  and  septic shock   and the protection of the functions of the vital organs are also essential for  SARS-CoV-2  patients  
 it has been known that a cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the  immune system  in  SARS  and MERS patients  
 cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response featured by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα  IL-1β  IL-2  IL-6  IFNα  IFNβ  IFNγ  and MCP-1  
 these cytokines induce immune cells to release a vast number of free radicals which are the major cause of  ARDS  and multiple organ failure  
 immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms  especially in severe patients  
 corticosteroids and tocilizumab  an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody  have been used to treat cytokine storm  
 other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include the modulation of T cell-directed immune response  the blockade of IFN-γ  IL-1  and TNF  Jak inhibition  blinatumomab  suppressor of cytokine signaling 4  and HDAC inhibitors  
 steroids  as immunosuppressants  were widely used in the treatment of  SARS  to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage  
 however  steroids at high dosages were not beneficial to severe lung injury in  SARS  and COVID-19 patients  
 instead  they may cause severe side effects  especially avascular osteonecrosis  dramatically affecting the  prognosis   
 nevertheless  short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses have been recommended to be used prudently for critically ill COVID-19 patients  
 at the time of writing  no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed  
 however  intravenous administration with remdesivir  a nucleotide analog  has been found to be efficacious in an American patient with COVID-19  
 Remdesivir is a novel  antiviral drug  developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by  Ebola  and Marlburg viruses  
 later  remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single stranded  RNA  viruses including MERS and  SARS  viruses  
 based on these  Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals  and the results are highly anticipated  
 in addition  baricitinb  interferon-α  lopinavir  ritonavir  and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute  respiratory   symptoms   
 diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  liver damage  and other adverse reactions can occur following combined therapy with lopinavir  ritonavir  
 the interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in the patients should be monitored carefully  
 plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation 
 the collection of the blood from patients who recovered from a  contagious  disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from catching the disease has a long history  
 indeed  recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the  pathogen  in their blood  
 antibodies are an immunoglobulin  Ig  produced by B lymphocytes to fight  pathogens  and other foreign objects and they recognize unique molecules in the  pathogens  and neutralize them directly  
 based on this  plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 seriously ill patients  
 their  symptoms  improved within 24 hours  accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood  
 however  verification and clarification are necessary to propose the method for large-scale use before specific therapies are not yet developed  
 in addition  given the therapeutic effects  some disadvantages associated with the plasma should be considered carefully  
 for example  antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome  which is potentially a life-threatening toxicity  
 the concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low  and the demand for the plasma is large to treat critically ill patients  
 it is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly enough to fight against a global  epidemic   
 thus  it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the  virus   
 this way  we can readily scale up the production of the antibodies  
 TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years  
 however  its effects largely rely on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM  
 most of the effective components remain unknown or are vague as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations  
 currently  due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19  TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate  symptoms  or for those who have recovered from severe stages  
 for example  Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment  
 top cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87  of their patients  including Gansu  637    Ningxia  50    and Hunan  50    whereas  Hubei  province  which used TCM in only approximately 30  of its COVID-19 patients  had the lowest cure rate  13    
 however  this is quite a rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patients should be included in the evaluation  
 on February 18  2020  Boli Zhang and coworkers published a study to compare western medicine  WM  treatment alone with combined treatment of WM and TCM  
 they found that the times needed for body temperature recovery   symptom  disappearance  and hospitalization were remarkably shorter in the WM  TCM group than in the WM only group  
 most impressively  the rate for  symptomatic  worsening  from light to severe  was remarkably lower for the WM  TCM group than for the WM only group  74  versus 462   and the mortality was lower in the WM  TCM group than WM only group  88  versus 39    
 nevertheless  the efficacy and safety of TCM still await more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centers  
 it would also be intriguing to characterize the mechanism of actions and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible  
 patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mostly experience great fear of the highly  contagious  and even fatal disease  and  quarantined  people also experience boredom  loneliness  and anger  
 furthermore   symptoms  of the  infection  such as  fever   hypoxia  and  cough  as well as adverse effects of the treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to more anxiety and mental distress  
 in the early phase of the  SARS   outbreak   a range of psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression  anxiety  panic attacks  psychomotor excitement  psychotic  symptoms   delirium  and even suicidality were reported  
 mandatory contact tracing and  quarantine   as a part of the public health responses to the  COVID-19 outbreak   can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of the  contagion    quarantine   and stigma on their families and friends  
 thus  mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients  suspected individuals  and people in contact with them as well as the general public who are in need  
 the psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams  clear communications with regular and accurate  updates  about the  SARS-CoV-2   outbreak  and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid  close contact  with each other  
 effective  vaccines  are essential for interrupting the chain of  transmission  from animal reservoirs and  infected  humans to susceptible hosts and are often complementary to  antiviral treatment  in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses  
 efforts have been made to develop S protein-based  vaccines  to generate long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies and  or protective  immunity  against  SARS-CoV   
 Live-attenuated  vaccines  have been evaluated in animal models for  SARS   
 however  the in vivo efficacy of these  vaccine  candidates in elderly individuals and lethal-challenge models and their protection against  zoonotic virus   infection  have yet to be determined before a clinical study is initiated  
 this is probably because  SARS  died down 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since  
 in contrast  sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and  spread  to other regions owing to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas  
 vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using inactivated  virus   DNA plasmids  viral vectors  nanoparticles  virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in animal models  
 the development of a safe and effective  vaccine  against  SARS-CoV-2  for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the ongoing  epidemic   
 however  it is challenging to overcome the difficulty because of the long period of time  averaged 18 months  needed for  vaccine  development and the dynamic variations of CoVs  
 as a novel disease  COVID-19 has just started to manifest its full clinical course throughout thousands of patients  
 in most cases  patients can recover gradually without sequelae  
 however  similar to  SARS  and MERS  COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases  
 therefore  building a  prognosis  model for the disease is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services  especially in resource-constrained areas  
 based on clinical studies reported thus far  the following factors may affect or be associated with the  prognosis  of COVID-19 patients  Table ​  Table33   
 age  age was the most important factor for the  prognosis  of  SARS   which is also true for COVID-19  
 COVID-19 mainly happened at the age of 30-65 with 477  of those patients being over 50 in a study of 8866 cases as described above  
 patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not  at the median age of 66 versus 51   suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients  
 sex   SARS-CoV-2  has  infected  more men than women  031  100000 versus 027  100000   as described above  
 comorbidities and complications  patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia  
 cardiac events were also the main reason for death in  SARS  patients  
 it has been reported that  SARS-CoV-2  can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes  which might lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients  
 it is worth noting that age and  underlying disease  are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other  
 abnormal laboratory findings  the C-reactive protein  CRP  level in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential prognostic factor for disease  response to therapy  and ultimate recovery  
 the correlation of CRP level to the severity and  prognosis  of COVID-19 has also been proposed  
 in addition  elevated lactate dehydrogenase  LDH   aspartate aminotransferase  AST   alanine aminotransferase  ALT   and creatine kinase  CK  may also help predict the outcome  
 these enzymes are expressed extensively in multiple organs  especially in the heart and liver  and are released during  tissue damage   
 thus  they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions  
 major clinical  symptoms   chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical  symptoms  should be considered together with the other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19  
 use of steroids  as described above  steroids are immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for  infectious  diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage  
 since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in severe  SARS  patients  many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor life quality  
 thus  if needed  steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients  
 mental stress  as described above  during the  COVID-19 outbreak  many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often endured long periods of  quarantine  and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients  
 it is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the stress and return to normal life  
 according to demographic studies so far  COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features from  SARS   
 in addition to replicating in the lower  respiratory  tract   SARS-CoV-2  can efficiently replicate in the upper  respiratory  tract and causes mild or no  symptoms  in the early phase of  infection   similar to other CoVs that cause  common colds   
 therefore   infected  patients at the early phase or  incubation period  can produce a large amount of  virus  during daily activities  causing great difficulty for the control of the  epidemic   
 however  the  transmission  of  SARS-CoV  was considered to occur when the patients are severely ill  while most transmission did not happen at the early phase  
 thus  the  current outbreak  of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of  SARS   
 great efforts are currently underway in China including the  lockdown  of  Wuhan  and surrounding cities and continuous  quarantine  of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2   
 although these actions have been dramatically damaging the economy and other sectors of the country  the number of new patients is declining  indicating the slowdown of the  epidemic   
 the most optimistic estimate is that the  outbreak  will end by March and the downswing phase will last for 3-4 months  
 however  some other experts are not that optimistic  
 Paul Hunter  et al   estimated that COVID-19  which seems substantially more  infectious  than  SARS   will not end in 2020  
 IRA Longini  et al   established a model to predict the outcome of the  epidemic  and suggested that  SARS-CoV-2  could  infect  two-thirds of the global population  
 a Canadian group reported that  SARS-CoV-2  was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat  swabs  of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier  which indicates that the newly identified  virus  could become a cyclical episode similar to  influenza   
 however  promising signs have occurred in China based on the declining number of new cases  indicating the current strategies might have been working  
  Ebola  was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million  deaths   
 however  via strict  quarantine  and  isolation   the disease has eventually been put under control  
 it is possible  similar to  SARS-CoV   that  SARS-CoV-2  might become weaker in  infectivity  and eventually die down or become a less pathogenic  virus  co-existent with humans  
 a comparison of the  epidemic  of COVID-19 with that of  SARS  and MERS is provided below  Fig  ​  Fig55   
  SARS-CoV-2  is highly transmittable through  coughing  or  sneezing   and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated by the  virus   
 the  virus  was also found in feces  which raises a new possibility of feces-to-mouth  transmission   
 a recent study on 138 cases reported that 41  of the cases were possibly caused by nosocomial  infections   including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 health-care providers  
 thus  great  precaution  should be used to protect humans  especially health-care providers  social workers  family members  colleagues  and even bystanders in contact with patients or  infected  people  
 the first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of  infection  is through wearing  face masks   both the use of surgical  masks  and N95 respirator  masks   series # 1860s  helps control the  spread  of viruses  
 surgical  face masks  prevent liquid  droplets  from a potentially  infected  individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto  surfaces  of materials  where they could be passed on to others  
 however  only N95  series # 1860s   masks  can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm  with only 5  of the virions being able to penetrate completely   SARS-CoV-2  is similar to  SARS-CoV  in size and both are approximately 85 nm  
 since particles can penetrate even five surgical  masks  stacked together  health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95  series # 1860s   masks  but not surgical  masks   
 in addition to  masks   health-care providers should wear fitted  isolation  gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses  
 viruses can also  infect  an individual through the eyes  
 on January 22  2020  a doctor was  infected  with  SARS-CoV-2  although he wore an N95 mask  the  virus  might have entered his body through his inflammatory eyes  
 thus  health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles while working with patients  
 for the general public in affected or potentially affected areas  it is highly suggested that everybody wash their hands with  disinfectant  soaps more often than usual  try to stay indoors for  self-quarantine  and limit contact with potentially  infected  individuals  
 three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient  
 these actions are effective methods to lower the risk of  infection  as well as prevent the  spread  of the  virus   
 although  SARS-CoV-2  came as a new  virus  to the human world  its high homology to  SARS-CoV  as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert to China based on her deep memory of the  SARS   outbreak  in 2003  
 however  not until 19 January 2020 did the director of the Center of Disease Control of  Wuhan  comfort the citizens by saying that the  novel virus  has low  contagiousness  and limited reproductivity from human to human and that it is not a problem to prevent and contain the disease  
 this message remarkably relaxed the alarm of the public  especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival  and the critical time was missed to contain the disease at its minimal scale in  Wuhan   
 the disease control agencies in China may take this hard lesson and make critical improvements in the future  
 for example  these agencies should be  1  more careful when making public announcements as every word counts to citizens and can change their attitude and decisions   2  more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials   3  more restrictive to contain a potential  epidemic  at its early stage rather than attempting to comfort the public  and  4  more often to issue targeted and effective drills to increase the public 's awareness about  epidemic diseases  and to test and improve the response system of the society periodically  
 the  outbreak  of COVID-19 caused by the  novel virus   SARS-CoV-2  started in the end of December 2019  
 in less than two months  it has spread all over China and near 50 other countries globally at the time of this writing  
 since the  virus  is very similar to  SARS-CoV  and the  symptoms  are also similar between COVID-19 and  SARS   the  outbreak  of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurring  
 however  there are some remarkable differences between COVID-19 and  SARS   which are essential for containing the  epidemic  and treating the patients  
 COVID-19 affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women  and the severity and  death rate  are also higher in elderly individual than in youth  
  SARS  has higher mortality than COVID-19  1091  versus 144    
 COVID-19 patients transmit the  virus  even when they are symptomless whereas  SARS  patients do so usually when they are severely ill  which causes much greater difficulty to contain the  spread  of COVID-19 than  SARS   
 this partially explains why  SARS-CoV-2   spread  much faster and broader than  SARS-CoV   
 the regular  RNA   assay  for  SARS-CoV-2  can be negative in some COVID-19 patients  
 on the other hand  cured patients can be positive for the  virus  again  
 these findings dramatically increase the risk of  virus   spreading   
 given such rapid progress in research on COVID-19  several critical issues remain to be solved  as follows  
 where did  SARS-CoV-2  come from  
 although 96  genetic homolog was found between  SARS-CoV-2  and two bat SARS-like CoVs  we still cannot conclude that  SARS-CoV-2  is from bats  
 what animal was the intermediate species to transmit the  virus  from the original host  say bats  to humans  
 without knowing answers to # 1 and 2  we cannot efficiently cut the  transmission   and the  outbreak  can relapse at any time  
 although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have demonstrated that  SARS-CoV-2  binds to ACE2  how exactly does the  virus  enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes  
 does the  virus  also bind ACE2-expressing cells in other organs  
 without clear answers to these questions  we cannot achieve fast and accurate diagnosis and  effective treatment   
 how long will the  epidemic  last  
 how is the  virus  genetically evolving during  transmission  among humans  
 will it become a  pandemic  worldwide  die down like  SARS  or relapse periodically like the  flu   
 it is essential but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions  
 however  with whatever expense it may demand  we have no other choice but to stop the  epidemic  as soon as possible and bring our life back to normal  




 zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses 
 mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses  CoVs  and their hosts  including human beings  for thousands of years  
 before 2003  two human CoVs  HCoVs  were known to cause mild  illness   such as  common cold   
 the  outbreaks  of severe acute  respiratory syndrome    SARS   and the Middle East  respiratory syndrome   MERS  have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV  infection  could be  
 the emergence of  SARS-CoV-2  in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high  transmissibility  but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister  SARS-CoV   
 HCoV  infection  is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well  
 most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic  
 the intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known  
 identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases  
 investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on COV pathogenesis in humans  
 in this review  we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs  with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies  transmission   
 importantly  we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of  virus  evolution and genome recombination  
 the current COV disease 2019  COVID-19   epidemic  is discussed in this context  
 in addition  the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of  virus  evolution on disease severity are also highlighted  
 Coronaviruses  CoVs  belong to the family Coronaviridae  which comprises a group of enveloped  positive-sensed  single-stranded  RNA  viruses  
 these viruses harbouring the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases amongst  RNA  viruses were termed “ CoVs ” because of their crown-like morphology under  electron microscope   
 structurally  CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization  
 approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large overlapping open reading frames  ORF1a and ORF1b   which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins  
 the polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins  designated nsp1 ~ 16  
 the remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for the structural proteins  including spike  S   envelope  E   membrane  M  and nucleoprotein  N   
 a number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs  
 based on the difference in protein sequences  CoVs are classified into four genera  alpha-CoV  beta-CoV  gamma-CoV and delta-CoV   among which the beta-CoV genera contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages  A  B  C and D   
 phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs  while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs  
 for thousands of years  CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human  pathogens   
 to date  seven human CoVs  HCoVs  are known  
 among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs  
 the other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43  HCoV-HKU1  severe acute  respiratory syndrome   Coronavirus    SARS-CoV    Middle East  respiratory syndrome   Coronavirus   MERS-CoV  and  SARS-CoV-2   
 HCoV-229E  HCoV-OC43  HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild  symptoms   like  common cold  and  or diarrhea  
 in contrast   SARS-CoV   MERS-CoV and the newly-identified  SARS-CoV-2  are highly pathogenic  causing severe lower respiratory tract  infection  in relatively more patients with a higher chance to develop  acute respiratory distress syndrome    ARDS   and extrapulmonary manifestations  
 the first HCoV-229E strain  B814  was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with  common cold  in mid-1960s  
 since then  more knowledge was accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43  both of which cause self-limiting  symptoms   
 indeed  the concept had been widely accepted that  infection  with HCoVs is generally harmless until the  outbreak  of  SARS   
 the  SARS   outbreak  occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history  infecting over 8000 people with a crude case fatality of approximately 10   
 ten years later  the Middle East  respiratory syndrome   MERS  outbreak resulted in a persistent  epidemic  in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spreading to the rest of the world  
 the 2019 novel HCoV   2019-nCoV    which has subsequently been renamed  SARS-CoV-2   is the  causative agent  of the ongoing  epidemic  of  Coronavirus disease  2019  COVID-19   which has claimed more than 3120 lives and  infected  more than 91000 people as of March 3  2020  
 the alarm has been ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming  pandemic  of  SARS-CoV-2   
 all seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin from bats  mice or domestic animals  
 multiple lines of evidence support an evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats  where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity  
 the  COVID-19 epidemic  has presented enormous medical  scientific  social and moral challenges to China and the world  
 tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the natural history  driving force and restriction factors of species jumping  
 this might also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir  intermediate and amplifying animal host  s  of  SARS-CoV-2   with important implications in the prevention of future spillovers  
 in this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins  interspecies  transmission  and pathogenesis of HCoVs  
 particularly  we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are typically non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after interspecies  transmission  to a new host  
 we also review the trend of HCoV evolution in which the increase in  transmissibility  often comes with the decrease in pathogenicity  
 the outcome of the ongoing  SARS-CoV-2   outbreak  is also discussed in this context  
 animal CoVs have been known since late 1930s  
 before the first  isolation  of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of patients who had contracted  common cold   different CoVs had been isolated in various  infected  animals  including turkey  mouse  cow  pig  cat and dog  
 in the past decades  seven HCoVs have been identified  
 a brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order  Table ​ 1  would be informative and instructive  
 the first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the  respiratory  tract of patients with upper  respiratory  tract  infection  in the year of 1966  and was subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines  
 patients  infected  with HCoV-229E presented with  common cold   symptoms   including headache   sneezing   malaise and sore-throat  with  fever  and  cough  seen in 10 ~ 20  cases  
 later in 1967  HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in brains of suckling mice  
 the clinical features of HCoV-OC43  infection  appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E  which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other  respiratory  tract pathogens such as  influenza  A viruses and rhinoviruses  
 both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally  and they tend to be predominantly transmitted during the season of winter in temperate climate  
 generally  the  incubation  time of these two viruses is less than one week  followed by an approximately 2-week  illness   
 according to a human volunteer study  healthy individuals  infected  with HCoV-229E developed mild  common cold   
 only a few  immunocompromised  patients exhibited severe lower  respiratory  tract  infection   
  SARS   also known as “ atypical  pneumonia  ”  was the first well documented HCoV-caused  pandemic  in human history and the etiological agent is  SARS-CoV   the third HCoV discovered  
 the first case of  SARS  can be traced back to late 2002 in  Guangdong  Province of China  
 the  SARS   epidemic  resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774  deaths   spreading across many countries and continents  
 apart from the super-spreaders  it was estimated that each case could give rise to approximately two secondary cases  with an  incubation period  of 4 to 7 days and the peak of viral load appearing on the 10th day of  illness   
 patients  infected  with  SARS-CoV  initially present with myalgia  headache   fever   malaise and chills  followed by dyspnea   cough  and  respiratory distress  as late  symptoms   
 lymphopenia  deranged liver function tests  and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of  SARS   
 diffuse alveolar damage  epithelial cell proliferation and an increase of macrophages are also observed in  SARS  patients  
 approximately 20-30  of patients subsequently require intensive care and  mechanical ventilation   
 in addition to lower  respiratory  tract  multiple organs including gastrointestinal tract  liver and kidney can also  be infected  in these severe cases  usually accompanied with a cytokine storm  which might be lethal particularly in  immunocompromised  patients  
 the  virus  was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou  
 since then  tremendous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research  
 HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands during late 2004  
 it was initially found to be prevalent in young children  the elderly and  immunocompromised  patients with  respiratory illnesses   
 presentation of coryza  conjunctivitis   fever   and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63  
 another independent study described the  isolation  of the same  virus  from a nasal specimen from an 8-month-old boy suffering from  pneumonia  in the Netherlands  
 although it was identified in Netherlands  it is actually distributed globally  
 it has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 47  of common  respiratory diseases   and its peak incidence occurs during early summer  spring and winter  
 HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis  also known as croup  
 in the same year  HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been  hospitalized  with  pneumonia  and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong  
 besides community-acquired  pneumonia  and bronchiolitis  HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation  
 similar to HCoV-NL63  HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43  HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide  causing mild  respiratory diseases   
 all these four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases  though accidents did occur for unknown reasons as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63  which has recently been reported to cause severe lower  respiratory  tract  infection  in China  
 generally  when these HCoVs acquire the abilities to transmit efficiently and to maintain themselves continuously within humans  they also become less virulent or pathogenic  
 MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute  pneumonia  and  renal failure  in Saudi Arabia  
 whereas most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East  imported cases with occasional secondary  spreads  to  close contacts  have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia  
 another secondary  outbreak  occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186  confirmed cases   
 clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of  SARS   characterized by progressive acute  pneumonia   
 unlike  SARS   many patients with MERS also developed acute  renal failure   which is thus far unique for MERS among HCoV-caused diseases  
 more than 30  of patients present with gastrointestinal  symptoms   such as diarrhea and vomiting  
 as of February 14  2020  over 2500 laboratory  confirmed cases  were reported with a high case fatality of 344   making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans  
 during middle to late December 2019  clusters of  pneumonia  patients retrospectively known to be associated with  SARS-CoV-2   infection  were detected in  Wuhan    Hubei  Province  China  
 world Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower  respiratory  tract  infection  caused by  SARS-CoV-2  a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and also named the disease COVID-19  
 as of March 3  2020  90053 cases have been confirmed worldwide  with a crude case fatality of 34   
 notably  the case fatality in  Hubei   China is 42   whereas the one outside of it is 12   
  SARS-CoV-2  causes severe  respiratory   infection  like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV  presented as  fever    cough  and dyspnea  
 diarrhea is also seen in some patients  
  pneumonia  is one of the most severe  symptoms  and can progress rapidly to  acute respiratory distress syndrome   
 although  SARS-CoV  and  SARS-CoV-2  are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology of 82   they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree  
  SARS-CoV-2  is apparently less pathogenic but more  transmissible  compared to  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV  
  asymptomatic  subjects  infected  with  SARS-CoV-2  have been reported and might contribute to its rapid  spreading  around the world  
 comparing and contrasting  SARS-CoV-2  with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest  
 first   the incubation period  and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar  
 in this regard   SARS-CoV-2  follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs  
 second  the severity of  symptoms  of COVID-19 lies between  SARS-CoV  and the four community-acquired HCoVs  ie HCoV-229E  HCoV-OC43  HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63   
 on one hand   SARS-CoV-2   infection  exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs  including the presentation of non-specific  mild or even no  symptoms   
 on the other hand  a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of  SARS-CoV   infection   although the ratio is a bit lower  
 third  the  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and  SARS-CoV   
 on one hand  the  transmissibility  of  SARS-CoV-2  is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs  
 on the other hand  it remains to be verified whether the  transmissibility  of  SARS-CoV-2  decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV  
 finally  same as the other HCoVs   SARS-CoV-2  can be detected in fecal samples  
 whether fecal-oral  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  plays an important role as in the case of  SARS-CoV  at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies  
 it is also of particularly great interest to see whether  SARS-CoV-2  might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs  
 nevertheless  the features of  SARS-CoV-2  including its  transmissibility   pathogenicity and sustainable  spreading  after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing  outbreak  of COVID-19  
 all four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild  symptoms  have been well adapted to humans  
 from another perspective  it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs  
 in other words  both could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics  
 HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated  
 for this to happen  HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors  
 in this sense  the longer the  SARS-CoV-2   outbreak  persists and the more people that it  infects   the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans  
 if it adapts well  its  transmission  in humans would be difficult to stop by  quarantine  or other  infection  control measures  
 for many years  the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations  triggering  common cold  in immunocompetent subjects  
 these viruses do not need an animal reservoir  
 in contrast  highly pathogenic  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and their  transmission  within humans cannot be sustained  
 they need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets  possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts  
  SARS-CoV-2  has features that are similar to both  SARS-CoV   MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs  
 it is highly  transmissible  like community-acquired HCoVs  at least for the time being  
 however  it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV  
 it remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host  
 before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs  it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary  natural  reservoir  intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs  
 an animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence  
 the ancestral  virus  is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host  
 likewise  a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and for long term  
 in both cases  the hosts are naturally  infected  and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental  virus   
 in contrast  if the HCoV is newly introduced to an  intermediate host  right before or around its introduction to humans  it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic  
 this  intermediate host  can serve as the zoonotic source of human  infection  and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the  virus  to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human  infection   
 an HCoV can undergo a dead-end  infection  if it cannot sustain its  transmission  within the  intermediate host   
 on the contrary  HCoVs can also adapt to the  intermediate host  and even establish long-term endemicity  
 in this case  the  intermediate host  becomes a natural reservoir host  
 epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the index case of  SARS  had a contact history with game animals  
 subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared with that of the general population  
 masked palm civets  Paguma larvata  and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to  SARS-CoV   
 this was indirectly supported by the fact that no further  SARS  was reported after killing all civets in the markets  
 however  it has been reported that masked palm civets from the wild or farms without  exposure  to the live animal markets were largely negative for  SARS-CoV   suggesting that masked palm civets might only serve as the intermediate amplifying host but not the natural reservoir of  SARS-CoV   
 notably  since 80  of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies  the possibilities that multiple species of small mammals might also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of  SARS-CoV  cannot be excluded  
 all of these appear to be dead-end hosts of  SARS-CoV   
 subsequent search for the natural animal host of  SARS-CoV  unveiled a closely related bat COV  termed SARS-related Rhinolophus bat COV HKU3  SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3   which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats  
 these bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3  
 this and other bat CoVs share 88-92  nucleotide sequence homology with  SARS-CoV   
 these studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging human  pathogens   
 several SARS-like CoVs  SL-CoVs  have also been identified from bats  but none except for one designated WIV1 can be isolated as live  virus   
 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2  is known to be the receptor of  SARS-CoV   
 WIV1 derived from fecal sample of bats was demonstrated to use bat  civet and human ACE2 as receptor for cell entry  
 Intriguingly  sera of convalescent  SARS  patients were capable of neutralizing WIV1  
 thus far  WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of  SARS-CoV  in bats  sharing 95  nucleotide sequence homology  
 albeit the high homology between these two viruses  it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental  virus  of  SARS-CoV  and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of  SARS-CoV   
 phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5  
 bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor  dipeptidyl peptidase 4  DPP4   for  virus  entry  
 RNA-dependent  RNA  polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa  
 up to now  no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats  
 MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87  nucleotide sequence homology  
 thus  bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV  
 on the other hand  studies in Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies  same as camels of Middle East origin in multiple African countries  
 live MERS-CoV identical to the  virus  found in humans was isolated from the nasal  swabs  of dromedary camels  further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV  
 it is also noteworthy that generally mild  symptoms  but massive  virus  shedding were observed in camels experimentally  infected  with MERS-CoV  
 notably   infected  camels shed viruses not only through  respiratory  route but also through fecal-oral route  which is also the main route for  virus  shedding from bats  
 however  questions still remain since many  confirmed cases  of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to  symptom   onset   plausibly ascribed to human-to-human  transmission  or unknown  transmission  routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbour MERS-CoV  
  SARS-CoV-2  shares 962  nucleotide homology with a bat COV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats  
 as in the cases of  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV  the sequence divergence between  SARS-CoV-2  and RaTG13 is too great to assign parental relationship  
 that is to say  bats might not be the immediate reservoir host  s  of  SARS-CoV-2  unless almost identical bat CoVs are found in future  
 presumably  the intermediate animal hosts of  SARS-CoV-2  should be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market  with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated  indicative of a probable animal-to-human  transmission  event  
 several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as  pangolins   Manis javanica  could also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to  SARS-CoV-2   
 these novel  pangolin  COV genomes share 85-92  nucleotide sequence homology with  SARS-CoV-2   
 however  they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90  identity at the level of nucleotide sequence  
 they cluster into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree  one of which share a more similar receptor binding domain  RBD  with  SARS-CoV-2   with 974  amino acid sequence identity  
 in stark contrast  the RBDs of  SARS-CoV-2  and RaTG13 are more divergent  albeit a higher degree of sequence homology genome-wide  
 an earlier study on diseased  pangolins  also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples  which turn out to be similarly related to  SARS-CoV-2   
 this study adopted different assembly methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 863  of the full-length viral genome  
 we cannot exclude the possibility that  pangolin  is one of the intermediate animal hosts of  SARS-CoV-2   
 however  currently there is no evidence in support of a direct  pangolin  origin of  SARS-CoV-2  due to the sequence divergence between  SARS-CoV-2  and  pangolin  SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs  
 in addition  the distance between  SARS-CoV-2  and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between  SARS-CoV-2  and  pangolin  SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs  
 the evolutionary pathway of  SARS-CoV-2  in bats   pangolins  and other mammals remains to be established  
 whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between  SARS-CoV-2  and  pangolin   SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs   SARS-CoV-2  and RaTG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology  
 it is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of  pangolin  SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and  SARS-CoV-2  is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution  
 a counter-proposal is in favour of a recombination between a  pangolin  SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species  
 as a driving force in evolution  recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs  
 the jury is still out on the immediate zoonotic origin of  SARS-CoV-2   
 besides the highly pathogenic HCoVs  the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E  HCoV-OC43  HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied  
 phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E might have originated from bat CoVs  while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents  
 it has been reported that a bat COV termed ARCoV2  Appalachian Ridge COV  detected in North American tricolored bat displayed close relationship with HCoV-NL63  
 on the other hand  HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat COV  termed Hipposideros  GhanaKwam  19  2008  which was detected in Ghana  while camelids have also been suspected as its  intermediate host   
 for clarity  the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure ​ 1 and Table 2  
 phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies  transmission  events of HCoVs in the history  
 when HCoV-OC43 crossed species to  infect  humans from domestic livestock around 1890  a  pandemic  of  respiratory   infection  was recorded  
 the interspecies  transmission  history of HCoV-229E is less clear  
 bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found  
 between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV  
 several lines of evidence support the  transmission  of  virus  from bats to humans directly  
 first  humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche  
 instead  humans have  close contact  with alpacas  
 second  HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats  whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused an  outbreak  of  respiratory disease  in  infected  animals  
 finally  alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals  
 thus  the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans  
 in fact  bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies  virus    Ebola   virus   Nipah  virus  and Hendra  virus   
 it is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly  
 alternatively  whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E  alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as  intermediate hosts  that transmit viruses to humans  exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV  
 MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies  transmission  from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans  
 the evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings  
 it is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of  virus  species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies  transmission   
 longevity  densely packed colonies  close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal '  virus  spreader '  
 on the other hand  MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades  
 it is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an  intermediate host  to a stable and natural reservoir host  
 MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals  
 its sporadic  transmission  to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its  transmission  cannot be sustained  
 in contrast to the role of camels in the  transmission  of MERS-CoV  the role of  pangolins   if there is any  in the  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  is different  
 particularly   pangolin  beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins  
 they might be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs  similar to civets in the case of  SARS-CoV   
 several possibilities for interspecies  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  from animals to humans have to be ruled in or ruled out in future studies  
 first  bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related  virus  almost identical to  SARS-CoV-2   
 humans might share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining  
 second   pangolins  could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a SARS-CoV-2-related  virus  had been newly introduced  
 humans contract the  virus  through butchering and consumption of game meat  
 it is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to  SARS-CoV-2   
 a survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted  
 third  as mentioned above  recombination and adaptation of  SARS-CoV-2  might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and  pangolins   
 the search for the animal origins of  SARS-CoV-2  is still on  
 apart from different types of the animal hosts  three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers  
 first of all  their relatively high mutation rates in  RNA  replication  
 in comparison to other single-stranded  RNA  viruses  the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be regarded as “ moderate ” to “ high ” with an average substitution rate being ~ 10-4 substitution per year per site 2  depending on the phase of COV adaptation to novel hosts  
 CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease  deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability  
 interestingly  the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress COV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent  RNA  polymerase  
 Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in  clinical trials   
 nevertheless  mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts  
 in addition  mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host  
 compared to  SARS-CoV  with a high mutation rate  the mutation rate of  SARS-CoV-2  is apparently lower  suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans  
 presumably  it has already been adapted to another host close to humans  
 in addition to  SARS-CoV-2   this also applies to MERS-CoV  which is well adapted to dromedary camels  
 theoretically  it is unlikely that genetic drift would render  vaccines  and antivirals against  SARS-CoV-2  ineffective quickly  
 second  the large  RNA  genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination  thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution  which is advantageous for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions become appropriate  
 this is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3 ′ end of the genome  
 third  CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during  RNA  replication through a unique “ copy-choice ” mechanism  
 in a host that serves as the mixing vessel  strand switching occurs frequently during COV  RNA  transcription  
 highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs  
 phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43  as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9  
 Virus-host interaction in relation to  transmission  
 besides three viral factors stated above  viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies  transmission   
 herein  recombination of  SARS-CoV  is taken as a typical example  which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies  transmission  events  
 based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoVs   SARS-CoV  is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts  particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein  
 generally  the RBD in the S protein of a COV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response  
 in  SARS-CoV   the RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment  which binds to the human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry  
 the RBD of  SARS-CoV  is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals  including bat  civet  mouse and raccoon dog  allowing interspecies  transmission  of the  virus   
 in fact  only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the RBD and 4 of them locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor  
 civet  SARS-CoV  has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD  which might increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptor  
 in other words  these two amino acid substitutions might be critical to viral adaption to humans  
 it is noteworthy that  SARS-CoV-2  shares the same cellular receptor with  SARS-CoV   
 a 30  difference between  SARS-CoV-2  and  SARS-CoV  in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 might have altered  
 indeed  a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and  SARS-CoV  S protein  
 it will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for  SARS-CoV-2   transmission   
 Intriguingly  HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S  
 there exist many other HCoV receptors  such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E  and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43  
 they might also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies  transmission  from their animal hosts  
 in addition to cellular receptors  the outcome of interspecies  transmission  of HCoVs is also governed by other host dependency and restriction factors  
 the divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats  dromedary camels and rodents might constitute a barrier to interspecies  transmission   
 HCoVs have to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for a successful interspecies  transmission   
 in this regard  molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain to be identified and characterized  
 an unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for  SARS-CoV-2  using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR might be fruitful  
 emergence of novel HCoVs  back to ground zero 
 the diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs  
 in this sense  bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs  
 in addition  rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process  
 for example  the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes  
 among  SARS-CoV  accessory proteins  ORF8 has been thought to be important in adaptation to humans  as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins  
 a 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human  epidemic   
 this deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the switch of hosts  
 besides   SARS-CoV  has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs  where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the RNA-dependent  RNA  polymerase  
 recombination locations were also identified in the nsp9  most of nsp10  and parts of nsp14  
 likewise  it has been shown that the  epidemic  MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages  which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia  
 besides  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV  recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs  in which the HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes  
 it should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes  most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted  such as by the host  immune system   
 an example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain  owing to a two-nucleotide deletion  
 while intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E  the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide insertion  resulting in a frameshift  
 last but not least  the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts  
  asymptomatic  or only mild  symptoms  were detected when bats were  infected  with CoVs  indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats  
 it appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically  
 for example  defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the  pathology  triggered by CoVs  
 besides  the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2  CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules  
 moreover  the high level of reactive oxygen species  ROS  generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress COV replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease  thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of  virus  strains highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host  
 more pathogenic COV strains might also evolve by recombination  leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation  
 thus  it is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades  
 CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild  symptoms  in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels  
 they replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response  
 herein lie the secrets of why  asymptomatic  carriers are seen and what causes the severe cases in human  infection   
 the severe  symptoms  are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm wherein the stronger the immune response  the more severe the lung damage  
 in contrast  in  asymptomatic  carriers  the immune response has been de-coupled from COV replication  
 the same strategy of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy  
 the interferon response is particularly strong in bats  
 thus  administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of  SARS-CoV-2   infection  in humans should be beneficial  
 in addition  NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective  
 by this reasoning  inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19  
 the emergence of  SARS-CoV-2  follows the general theme by which  SARS-CoV  and MERS-CoV arose  
 whereas a bat beta-CoV sharing 95  nucleotide homology with  SARS-CoV  has been found  there also exists a bat-CoV sharing 96  nucleotide homology with  SARS-CoV-2   
 whereas civets and other animals in the markets have been found to harbour viruses identical to  SARS-CoV   immediate  intermediate hosts  for  SARS-CoV-2  have not been identified  
 Pangolin beta-CoVs strikingly homologous to  SARS-CoV-2  have been found  indicating that pangolins might serve as one of  intermediate hosts  or  pangolin  beta-CoVs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of  SARS-CoV-2   
 although questions remain  there is no evidence that  SARS-CoV-2  is man-made either deliberately or accidentally  
 CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent  outbreak  of  SARS-CoV-2   
 the study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human  transmission   
 pervasive evidence has shown that  SARS-CoV   MERS-CoV and  SARS-CoV-2  have a bat origin and are transmitted to humans via  intermediate hosts   
 given that  SARS-CoV   infection  originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets  closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively ended the  SARS   epidemic   
 by the same reasoning  pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic  transmission   in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of  pangolin  beta-CoVs closely related to  SARS-CoV-2   
 however  whether and how  SARS-CoV-2  is transmitted to humans through  pangolins  and other mammals remain to be clarified in future investigations  
 on the other hand  MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time  
 these camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as a main source of meat  milk  leather and wool products for the local people  
 they are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa  
 it is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS  as what was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the  spreading  of  SARS-CoV  and  SARS-CoV-2   
 to stop the recurrent  outbreaks  of MERS  a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective  vaccines  against MERS-CoV for camels  in combination with other  infection  control measures  
 as we are not able to eliminate these viruses  new genotypes might emerge to cause  outbreaks   
 a variety of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild  
 particularly  bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are so diverse  
 there are plenty of opportunities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine  resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more  transmissible  and  or  deadly  in humans in future  
 the culture of eating wild animals in some places of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals  
 with the ordeals of  SARS   MERS and COVID-19  a better  preparedness  and response plan should be in place  
 in fact  many viruses have existed in the planet for a very long time  
 they stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover  
 although bats have many features that favours the  spreading  of viruses  the chance for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from them  
 continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts  which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human  transmission  and future  outbreaks   
 to conclude  the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses  
 several pieces in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of  SARS-CoV-2  are still missing  
 first  if bats transmit an ancestral  virus  of  SARS-CoV-2  to  pangolins   it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and  pangolins  could share the same ecological niche  
 second  if bats play a more direct role in human  transmission   how humans get into contact with bats should be determined  
 third  if a third mammal acts as the true  intermediate host   how it interacts with the different species including humans  bats and  pangolins  has to be clarified  
 finally  since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to  SARS-CoV-2   both surveillance and experimental  infection  should be conducted  
 should it be a bat  a  pangolin  or another mammal  it is expected that  SARS-CoV-2  or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in future  
 continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of  SARS-CoV-2  in animals  with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans  




 updating the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 “ suspected case ” and “ confirmed case ” is necessary 
 on 6 February 2020  our team had published a rapid advice guideline for diagnosis and treatment of  2019 novel Coronavirus    2019-nCoV   infection  and this guideline provided our experience and make well reference for fighting against this  pandemic  worldwide  
 however  the  Coronavirus disease  2019  COVID-19  is a new disease  our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience  hence  the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated  
 in this letter  we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of “ suspected case ” and “ confirmed case ” according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19  seventh version  that issued by the National Health Committee of the People ’ s Republic of China  
 in December 2019  the  2019 novel Coronavirus    2019-nCoV   has caused an  outbreak   which is now officially named as the  Coronavirus disease  2019  COVID-19  and the  virus  has been named severe acute  respiratory syndrome   Coronavirus  2   SARS-CoV-2    
 on 11 March 2020   WHO  characterized COVID-19 as a  pandemic   
 in order to fight against the  SARS-CoV-2   infection   our team has developed a rapid advice guideline and that has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020  
 it has attracted a great attention since published  
 note however that COVID-19 is a new disease  our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience  hence  the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated  
 for instance the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People ’ s Republic of China  http    wwwnhcgovcn    among 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020  has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts being substantively changed  
 now our guideline received a comment by Zhou et al   they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience  
 their work added new evidence for our guideline and also make valuable reference for this  pandemic  worldwide  
 we endorse their significant work and express our thanks  
 however  their work also needs update according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19  Trial seventh version  and recently studies  
 according to the seventh edition  3 March 2020   to confirm the suspected case needs to combine any one item of epidemiological history features with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis  or needs to meet three items of clinical manifestations if without clear epidemiological history  
 epidemiological history   1  a history of travel or residence in  Wuhan  city and surrounding areas  or other communities where COVID-19 cases had been reported in the last 14 days before  symptom   onset    2  a history of contact with  SARS-CoV-2   infectious  cases  with positive nucleic acid test    3  a history of contacting with patients with  fever  or  respiratory  symptoms from  Wuhan  city and surrounding areas  or other communities where COVID-19 had been reported in the last 14 days before  symptom   onset    4  a history of contacting with cluster of  confirmed cases   ≥ 2 cases with  fever  and  or  respiratory  symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas  such as home  office  class of school  etc   
 clinical manifestations   1   fever  and  or  respiratory   symptoms    2  with imaging features of COVID-19  infection    3  total white blood cell counts showing normal  decreased  or reduced lymphocyte count in the early  onset  stage  
 diagnosing the confirmed case should base on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence as following   1  real-time PCR test positive for  SARS-CoV-2    2  viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the known novel coronaviruses   3  positive for the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to  SARS-CoV-2  in serum test  or a change of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody from negative to positive  or titer rising ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase  
 we can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in  respiratory  tract or blood samples was added to the second  18 January 2020  and third  22 January 2020  editions  
 the pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth  27 January 2020  and fifth  8 February 2020  editions  and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition  
 these modifications based on the researchers continued work that to search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis  as well as the samples from  respiratory  tract including blood sampling  which increased the availability of different specimens  and supported bringing the specific antibody positive result into the confirmed criteria  
 besides  there are more and more evidence that remind us to caution with the atypical  symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  patients  
 hence  the flow chart of Zhou et al should be updated  as they classified the person without clinical  symptoms  as “ low risk ”  
 the score system also needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies  
 to conclude  we hope more direct evidence coming up and call for readers to provide their comments  
 for the diagnosis of “ suspected case ” and “ confirmed case ”  we suggest to trace and obey the newest guidelines of their home countries  
 our team will also timely update our guideline to offer help  




 Bangladesh reports five new  deaths  due to COVID-19  a daily highest 
 yesterday  Bangladesh has confirmed five new  deaths  due to COVID-19 on the day  
 this is the highest number of fatalities in a day due to the  virus   
 as of yesterday  Bangladesh 's Institute of Epidemiology  Disease Control and Research  IEDCR  reported the number of recorded  infected  cases included 114  active cases  and 33 recovered cases who were staying home  
 a total of 17  deaths  have been recorded  
 in an online news briefing  the director of IEDCR  Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora  said the fatalities included four males and one female  
 according to Dr Meerjady  two cases were aged above 60  two between 51 and 60  and one 41-50 years old  
 she also said two of the victims were from Dhaka  
 the  World Health Organization    WHO   declared COVID-19 a  pandemic  on March 11  
 a hospital official told Anadolu Agency  a local news outlet  that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman  a director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission  who was cared for at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital  
 on Saturday  in an online video announcement  Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be shut down for longer than initially planned  until this coming Saturday  
 this public transport shutdown had initially started on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday  April 4  
 transport of essential goods -- medical  fuel and food -- was still allowed  
 the first recorded incidents of COVID-19  infection  in Bangladesh were on March 8  in two people who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them  
 as of March 19  these three had already recovered  




  SARS-CoV-2  surpasses one million infections worldwide 
 on Thursday  the total number of cases of the  SARS-CoV-2   Coronavirus   infections  surpassed one million worldwide  Johns Hopkins University data indicated  
 at least 52 thousand  deaths  were linked to COVID-19  the disease caused by the  Coronavirus   
 the milestone came the same day Malawi confirmed its first  Coronavirus  infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death  
 North Korea claimed  as of Thursday  it was one of the few countries remaining free of  Coronavirus  infections  
 by yesterday  the  World Health Organization  reported 1051635  confirmed cases   including 79332 cases in the twenty four hours preceding 10 am Central European Time  0800 UTC  on April 4  
 in the United States  over 244 thousand  Coronavirus cases  were recorded  linking to at least 5900  deaths   
 CBS News reported  citing Johns Hopkins University data  there were over 1000 US  deaths  on Wednesday caused by  Coronavirus  infections  
 around the world  countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the disease from  spreading   
 on Thursday  Sergei Sobyanin  the mayor of Moscow  extended the city  lockdown  to May 1  
 nationally  President Vladimir Putin declared Russians would continue to be paid without going to work until April 30  
 the parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days  the vote passed with 215 votes in favor  ten abstentions  and one vote against  
 Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to last the entire day  previously  the curfew was only in effect between 3 pm and 6 am  
 Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10 pm and 4 am  
 the governor of Ohio  Mike DeWine  announced the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1  




 stores in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction 
 on Sunday and Saturday evening  Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase  restrictions  on toilet paper to two and one package per transaction in all stores on national level  respectively  
 ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit  on Monday  
 these limitations were posted as messages on the checkouts  and on the chains ' Facebook pages  
 buyers were reportedly stocking up due to fears of COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate  
 on Wednesday  Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order  
 these changes followed the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively  
 Coles  in its March 8 media release  reported that with the four-pack restriction in place   many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery   and called the demand  unprecedented   while ALDI  in a Facebook post on Tuesday  called it  unexpected   
 sales went up in a  sharp increase  last week  according to a Woolworths spokesperson  
 Costco 's store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week  
 to further alleviate the shortage  Coles ordered bigger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency  Woolworths ordered extra stock  while ALDI made stocks for a planned Wednesday special available early  
 Russell Zimmerman  executive director of the Australian Retailers Association  said that retailers try to raise stock  but local council  restrictions  on the timing of truck-deliveries make it hard  
 he expects rising production costs  as suppliers try to meet demand  and fewer specials  
 on Tuesday  ALDI announced that following the early release of stock  some stores can 't run the Wednesday special  
 in a Newscomau report  Dr Gary Mortimer  retail expert from Queensland University of Technology  said the stores fill the stock every night  
 he remarked toilet paper is a bulky item  leading to low quantity of stocks in numbers  and  when sold out  leaves vast shelf spaces empty  hardening the feeling of a shortage  
 Coles and Woolworths have a view [ that ] if there was plenty of stuff on the shelf  if product like toilet rolls and sanitiser could be [ bought ] and are there in quantities  you would probably minimise the panic said Russell Zimmerman per ABC News  
 recycled toilet paper producer Who Gives a Crap said on last Wednesday they 'd run out of stock  
 Kimberly-Clark  which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue  and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent  emphasized they were working 24  7 to maintain the supply  according to the Newscomau report  
 Domaincom  a real estate site  reported some property sellers offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on auctions in Melbourne  when fewer auctions were held because of buyers having time off on the long weekend of Labour Day  
 the Thursday edition of NT News  a daily printed in Darwin  included an eight-page insert meant to be cut up and used as toilet paper  
 the stores were originally reluctant to impose  restrictions   according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to introduce  restrictions  on the purchases  
 Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand  including  masks   sanitiser  dried goods  handwash and flour  
 similarly  outside of Australia  on Sunday evening online British supermarket Ocado was observed limiting purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs  




 world Health Organization declares  COVID-19 pandemic  
 on Wednesday  the  World Health Organization    WHO   declared the  ongoing outbreak  of COVID-19 — the disease caused by  Coronavirus   SARS-CoV-2  — to be a  pandemic   
 although the word   pandemic   only refers to how widely a disease has  spread   not how dangerous specific cases are  the  WHO  noted the need to drive governments to action  
 all countries can still change the course of this  pandemic   
 if countries detect  test  treat  isolate  trace and mobilize their people in the response  said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  the Director-General of the  WHO   
 we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of  spread  and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction  
 according to Dr Tom Frieden  formerly the director of the United States ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  the  pandemic  is  unprecedented   
 he said  in remarks published by CNN in February   other than  influenza   no other  respiratory virus  has been tracked from emergence to continuous global  spread    
 Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view  saying  we have never before seen a  pandemic  sparked by a  Coronavirus    
 he continued   and we have never before seen a  pandemic  that can be controlled at the same time   
 the new status as a  pandemic  follows the  WHO  's decision in January to declare the  outbreak  a public health emergency of international concern  
 the United States ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease 's director  Dr Anthony Fauci  said of the  outbreak    bottom line  it 's going to get worse   
 as of Thursday  Associated Press reported there were at least 126000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide  resulting in over 4600  deaths   




 the 2019 – 20  Coronavirus pandemic  is an ongoing pandemic of  Coronavirus disease  2019  COVID-19   caused by severe acute  respiratory syndrome   Coronavirus  2   SARS-CoV-2    
 the  outbreak  was identified in  Wuhan   China  in December 2019  declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020  and recognized as a  pandemic  on 11 March 2020  
 as of 10 April 2020  approximately 161 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories  resulting in approximately 97000  deaths   
 about 364000 people have recovered  
 the  case fatality rate  has been estimated to be 4  in China  while globally ranging from 1304  in Algeria to 08  in New Zealand  
 common  symptoms  include  fever    cough  and  shortness of breath   
 complications may include  pneumonia  and  acute respiratory distress syndrome   
 the time from  exposure  to  onset  of  symptoms  is typically around five days  but may range from two to fourteen days  
 there is no known  vaccine  or specific  antiviral treatment   
 primary treatment is  symptomatic  and supportive therapyRecommended preventive measures include hand washing  covering one 's mouth when  coughing   maintaining distance from other people  and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are  infected   
 authorities worldwide have responded by implementing  travel restrictions    quarantines   curfews  workplace hazard controls  and facility closures  
 the  pandemic  has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption  the postponement or cancellation of sporting  religious  political and cultural events  and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying  
 schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 193 countries  affecting approximately 994 percent of the world 's student population  
 misinformation about the  virus  has spread online  and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people  other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance  and others from areas with significant  virus  cases  
 due to reduced travel and closures of heavy industry  there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions  
 health authorities in  Wuhan   China  the capital of  Hubei  province  reported a cluster of  pneumonia  cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019  and an investigation was launched in early January 2020  
 the cases mostly had links to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and so the  virus  is thought to have a zoonotic origin  
 the  virus  that caused the  outbreak  is known as  SARS-CoV-2   a newly discovered  virus  closely related to bat coronaviruses   pangolin  coronaviruses  and SARS-CoVThe earliest known person with  symptoms  was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019  and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster  
 of the early cluster of cases reported in December 2019  two-thirds were found to have a link with the market  
 on 13 March 2020  an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case traced back to 17 November 2019  in a 55-year-old from  Hubei  province  may have been the firstOn 26 February 2020  the  WHO  reported that  as new cases reportedly declined in China but suddenly increased in Italy  Iran  and South Korea  the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time  
 there may be substantial underreporting of cases  particularly among those with milder  symptoms   
 by 26 February  relatively few cases had been reported among youths  with those 19 and under making up 24  of cases worldwideThe United Kingdom 's chief scientific adviser  Patrick Vallance  estimated that 60  of the British population would need to become  infected  before effective herd  immunity  could be achieved  
 cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19  and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols  
 as of 23 March  no country had tested more than 3  of its population  and many countries have had official policies not to test those with only mild  symptoms   such as Italy  the Netherlands  Spain  and Switzerland  
 a study published on 16 March found that in China  up to 23 January  an estimated 86  of COVID-19 infections had not been detected  and that these undocumented infections were the  infection  source for 79  of documented cases  
 a statistical analysis published 30 March estimated that numbers of  infections  in Italy were considerably greater than the reported cases  
 the initial estimates of the basic reproduction number  R0  for COVID-19 were 14 to 24  
 a study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it may be 57  
 most people with COVID-19 recover  
 for those who do not  the time from development of  symptoms  to death has been between 6 and 41 days  with the most common being 14 days  
 as of 10 April 2020  approximately 97000  deaths  had been attributed to COVID-19  
 in China  as of 5 February about 80  of  deaths  were in those over 60  and 75  had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetesOfficial tallies of  deaths  from the  COVID-19 pandemic  generally refer to dead people who tested positive for  COVID  according to official protocols  
 the number of true fatalities from COVID-19 may be much higher  as it may not include people who die without testing - eg at home  in nursing homes  etc  
 partial data from Italy found that the number of excess  deaths  during the  pandemic  exceeded the official  COVID  death tally by a factor of 4-5x  
 a spokeswoman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   CDC   acknowledged  We know that [ the stated  death toll  ] is an underestimation   a statement corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the US Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics  such as the 2009  H1N1   swine flu  epidemicThe first confirmed death was in  Wuhan  on 9 January 2020  
 the first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines  and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February  
 by 28 February  outside mainland China  more than a dozen  deaths  each were recorded in Iran  South Korea  and Italy  
 by 13 March  more than forty countries and territories had reported  deaths   on every continent except AntarcticaSeveral measures are commonly used to quantify mortality  
 these numbers vary by region and over time  and are influenced by the volume of testing  healthcare system quality  treatment options  time since initial  outbreak   and population characteristics such as age  sex  and overall healthThe death-to-case ratio reflects the number of  deaths  divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval  
 based on Johns Hopkins University statistics  the global death-to-case ratio is 60   97039  1617204  as of 10 April 2020  
 the number varies by region  
 in China  estimates for the death-to-case ratio decreased from 173   for those with  symptom   onset  1 – 10 January 2020  to 07   for those with  symptom   onset  after 1 February 2020  Other measures include the  case fatality rate   CFR   which reflects the percent of diagnosed people who die from a disease  and the  infection  fatality rate  IFR   which reflects the percent of  infected   diagnosed and undiagnosed  who die from a disease  
 these statistics are not Timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution  
 a number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations  
 the University of Oxford 's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the  infection   fatality rate  for the  pandemic  as a whole is between 01  and 039   
 the upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results from the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany  and a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates  
 the  WHO  asserts that the  pandemic  can be controlled  
 the peak and ultimate duration of the  outbreak  are uncertain and may differ by location  
 Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated   Left unchecked   infectious   outbreaks  typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts  
 but it 's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be   
 the Chinese government 's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that  it could be over by June  if all countries can be mobilized to follow the  WHO  's advice on measures to stop the  spread  of the  virus   
 on 17 March  Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that  SARS-CoV-2   is going to be circulating  potentially for a year or two   
 according to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson  physical distancing and other measures will be required  until a  vaccine  becomes available  potentially 18 months or more    
 William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated   I think it 's unlikely that this  Coronavirus  — because it 's so readily  transmissible  — will disappear completely  and it  might turn into a seasonal disease  making a comeback every year   
 the  virulence  of the comeback would depend on herd  immunity  and the extent of mutation  
  symptoms  of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and  infected  people may be  asymptomatic   
 the two most common  symptoms  are  fever   88   and  dry cough   68    
 less common  symptoms  include fatigue   respiratory   sputum  production   phlegm    loss of the sense of smell   shortness of breath   muscle and joint pain   sore throat   headache  chills  vomiting  hemoptysis  diarrhea  or cyanosisThe  WHO  states that approximately one person in six becomes seriously ill and has  difficulty breathing   
 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   CDC   lists emergency  symptoms  as  difficulty breathing   persistent chest pain or pressure  sudden confusion  difficulty waking  and bluish face or lips  immediate medical attention is advised if these  symptoms  are presentFurther development of the disease can lead to severe  pneumonia    acute respiratory distress syndrome    sepsis    septic shock  and death  
 some of those  infected  may be  asymptomatic   with no clinical  symptoms  but with test results that confirm infection  so researchers have issued advice that those with  close contact  to confirmed  infected  people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection  
 Chinese estimates of the  asymptomatic  ratio range from few to 44   
 the usual  incubation period   the time between  infection  and  symptom   onset   ranges from one to 14 days  it is most commonly five daysAs an example of uncertainty  the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30  and later fell to 15   
 some details about how the disease is  spread  are still being determined  
 the disease is believed to be primarily  spread  during  close contact  and by small  droplets  produced during  coughing    sneezing   or talking  with  close contact  being within 1 to 2 metres  3 to 6 feet   
 studies have found that an uncovered  coughing  can lead to  droplets  travelling up to 45 metres  15 feet  to 82 metres  27 feet   
 some have proposed that the  virus  may also be transmitted by small  droplets  that stay for more prolonged periods in the air  that may be generated during speechRespiratory  droplets  may also be produced during  breathing  out  including when talking  though the  virus  is not generally airborne  
 the droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the  lungs   
 some medical procedures such as  intubation  and cardiopulmonary resuscitation  CPR  may cause  respiratory   secretions  to be aerosolized and thus result in airborne  spread   
 it may also spread when one  touches  a contaminated  surface   including skin  and then touches their eyes  nose  or mouth  
 while there are concerns it may  spread  by faeces  this risk is believed to be low  
 the Government of China denied the possibility of faecal-oral  transmission  of SARS-CoV-2The  virus  is most  contagious  during the first three days after  onset  of  symptoms   although  spread  may be possible before  symptoms  appear and in later stages of the disease  
 people have tested positive for the disease up to three days before  onset  of  symptoms  suggesting  transmission  is possible before developing significant  symptoms   
 only few reports of laboratory-confirmed  asymptomatic  cases exist  but asymptomatic  transmission  has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations  
 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control  ECDC  states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads  one person generally infects two to three othersThe  virus  survives for hours to days on  surfaces   
 specifically  the  virus  was found to be  detectable  for up to three days on plastic  polypropylene  and 304 stainless steel  for one day on cardboard  and for up to four hours on copper  
 this  however  varies based on the humidity and temperaturePets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19  
 there is no evidence animals can pass the  virus  on to humans  though British authorities advise washing one 's hands after contact with animals  like after contact with other  surfaces   infected  people could have  touched   
 severe acute  respiratory syndrome   Coronavirus  2   SARS-CoV-2   is a  novel virus   first isolated from three people with  pneumonia  connected to the cluster of acute  respiratory illness  cases in  Wuhan   
 all features of the novel  SARS-CoV-2   virus  occur in related coronaviruses in natureOutside the human body  the  virus  is killed by household soap  which dissolves its protective envelopeSARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original  SARS-CoV   
 it is thought to have a zoonotic origin  
 genetic analysis has revealed that the  Coronavirus  genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus  in subgenus Sarbecovirus  lineage B  together with two bat-derived strains  
 it is 96  identical at the whole genome level to other bat  Coronavirus  samples  BatCov RaTG13   
 in February 2020  Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the viruses from  pangolins  and those from humans  
 Whole-genome comparison to date has found at most 92  of genetic material shared between  pangolin   Coronavirus  and  SARS-CoV-2   which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the  intermediate host   
 infection by the  virus  can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of  symptoms   though confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  rRT-PCR  of  infected   secretions  or CT imaging  
 a study comparing PCR to CT in  Wuhan  has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR  though less specific  with many of its imaging features overlapping with other  pneumonias  and disease processes  
 as of March 2020  the American College of Radiology recommends that  CT should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19   
 the  WHO  has published several  RNA  testing protocols for  SARS-CoV-2   with the first issued on 17 January  
 the test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  rRT-PCR   
 the test can be done on  respiratory  or blood samples  
 results are generally available within a few hours to days  
 generally this test is carried out on a nasopharyngeal  swab  though a throat  swab  may also be usedA number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests  which detect antibodies  
 as of 6 April 2020  none of these has been proved sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use  
 in the US a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only  
 characteristic imaging features on radiographs and computed tomography  CT  of people who are  symptomatic  include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions  
 the Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for  confirmed cases   
 due to overlap with other  infections  such as adenovirus  imaging without confirmation by PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19  
 a large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the  infection   it is faster and more sensitive  suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in  epidemic  areas  
 artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect imaging features of the  virus  with both radiographs and CT  
 strategies for preventing  transmission  of the disease include maintaining overall good personal  hygiene    washing hands   avoiding  touching  the eyes  nose  or mouth with unwashed hands  and  coughing  or  sneezing  into a tissue and putting the tissue directly into a waste container  
 those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public  
 physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmissionMany governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the  outbreak   
 however  the  virus  has reached the stage of  community spread  in large parts of the world  
 this means that the  virus  is spreading within communities  and some community members don 't know where or how they were infectedHealth care providers taking care of someone who may  be infected  are recommended to use standard  precautions   contact  precautions   and eye protectionContact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an  infection  and to prevent further  transmission   
 the use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns  with Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance  
 various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use  and as of April 7  2020  over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions  such as using Bluetooth to log a user 's proximity to other cellphones  
 users then receive a message if they 've been in  close contact  with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent  infection   for example  rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective  
 there is no COVID-19  vaccine   though many organizations are working to develop one  
 hand washing is recommended to prevent the  spread  of the disease  
 the  CDC  recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds  especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty  before eating  and after blowing one 's nose   coughing   or  sneezing   
 this is because outside the human body  the  virus  is killed by household soap  which bursts its protective bubble  
  CDC  further recommended using an  alcohol-based hand sanitizer  with at least 60  alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available  
 the  WHO  advises people to avoid  touching  the eyes  nose  or mouth with unwashed hands  
  surfaces  may be  decontaminated  with a number of solutions  within one minute of  exposure  to the  disinfectant  for a stainless steel  surface    including 62 – 71  ethanol  50 – 100   isopropanol   01  sodium hypochlorite  05   hydrogen peroxide   and 02 – 75  povidone-iodine  
 other solutions  such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate  are less effective  
 the  CDC  recommends that if a  COVID  case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care  all areas such as offices  bathrooms  common areas  shared electronic equipment like tablets  touch screens  keyboards  remote controls  and ATM machines used by the ill persons  should be disinfected  
 health organizations recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when  coughing  or  sneezing   and disposing of any tissue immediately  
 surgical  masks  are recommended for those who may  be infected   as wearing a mask can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory  droplets  dispersed when talking   sneezing   and  coughing   
 the  WHO  has issued instructions on when and how to use  masks   
 according to Stephen Griffin  a virologist at the University of Leeds   Wearing a mask can reduce the propensity [ of ] people to  touch  their faces  which is a major source of  infection  without proper hand  hygiene     masks  have also been recommended for use by those taking care of someone who may have the disease  
 the  WHO  has recommended the wearing of  masks  by healthy people only if they are at high risk  such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19  although they also acknowledge that wearing masks may help people avoid  touching  their face  
 several countries have started to encourage the use of  face masks  by members of the public  
 in the US  the  CDC  recommends wearing non-medical face mask made out of clothChina has specifically recommended the use of  disposable  medical  masks  by healthy members of the public  particularly when coming into  close contact   1 metre  3 ft  or less  with other people  
 Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places  
 Thailand 's health officials are encouraging people to make cloth facemasks at home and wash them daily  
 the Czech Republic and Slovakia banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering one 's nose and mouth  
 on 16 March  Vietnam requested everyone to wear a  face mask  when going to public areas in order to protect themselves and others  
 the Austrian government mandated that everyone entering a grocery store must wear a  face mask   
 Israel has asked all residents to wear face  masks  when in public  
 Taiwan  which has been producing ten million  masks  per day since mid-March  required passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear face masks on 1 April  
 Panama has made it obligatory to wear a  face mask  whenever going outside  while also recommending the manufacture of a homemade  face mask  for those who cannot purchase  face masks   
  face masks  have also been widely used in Japan  South Korea  Malaysia  and Singapore  
  social distancing   also known as physical distancing  includes  infection  control actions intended to slow the  spread  of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals  
 methods include  quarantines    travel restrictions   and the closing of schools  workplaces  stadiums  theatres  or shopping centres  
 individuals may apply  social distancing  methods by staying at home  limiting travel  avoiding crowded areas  using no-contact greetings  and physically distancing themselves from others  
 many governments are now mandating or recommending  social distancing  in regions affected by the  outbreak   
 the maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people  if there was no known COVID-19  spread  in a region  to 50 people  and later to 10 people  
 on 22 March 2020  Germany banned public gatherings of more than two peopleOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as  diabetes   heart disease   respiratory disease   hypertension  and compromised  immune systems  face increased risk of serious  illness  and complications and have been advised by the  CDC  to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreakIn late March 2020  the  WHO  and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term   social distancing   with  physical distancing   to clarify that the aim is to reduce  physical contact  while maintaining social connections  either virtually or at a distance  
 the use of the term   social distancing   had led to implications that people should engage in complete  social isolation   rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative meansSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the  pandemic   
 these include recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with  who does not have the  virus  or  symptoms  of the virus  
 Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been  infected   
 health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolationMany governments have mandated or recommended  self-quarantine  for entire populations living in affected areas  
 the strongest  self-quarantine  instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups  
 those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with  widespread transmission  have been advised to  self-quarantine  for 14 days from the time of last possible  exposure   
 strategies in the control of an  outbreak  are containment or suppression  and mitigation  
 containment is undertaken in the early stages of the  outbreak  and aims to trace and isolate those  infected  as well as introduce other measures of  infection  control and vaccinations to stop the disease from  spreading  to the rest of the population  
 when it is no longer possible to contain the  spread  of the disease  efforts then move to the mitigation stage  measures are taken to slow the  spread  and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society  
 a combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time  
 suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the  pandemic  by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1Part of managing an  infectious   disease outbreak  is trying to decrease the  epidemic peak   known as flattening the  epidemic curve   
 this decreases the risk of  health services  being overwhelmed and provides more time for  vaccines  and treatments to be developed  
 Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the  outbreak  include personal preventive measures  such as hand  hygiene   wearing face-masks  and  self-quarantine   community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events  community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions  as well as environmental measures such  surface  cleaningMore drastic actions aimed at containing the  outbreak  were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent  such as  quarantining  entire cities and imposing strict travel bans  
 other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the  spread  of the  virus   
 South Korea introduced mass screening and localized  quarantines   and issued alerts on the movements of  infected  individuals  
 Singapore provided financial support for those  infected  who  quarantined  themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so  
 Taiwan increased  face mask  production and penalized hoarding of medical suppliesSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation  slowing but not stopping  epidemic   spread   and suppression  reversing  epidemic  growth  have major challenges  
 optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2  3 and  deaths  by half  but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed  
 suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the  virus  is circulating in the human population  or until a  vaccine  becomes available  if that comes first   as  transmission  otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed  
 long-term intervention to suppress the  pandemic  causes social and economic costs  
 there are no specific antiviral medications approved for COVID-19  but development efforts are underway  including testing of existing medications  
 taking over-the-counter cold medications  drinking fluids  and resting may help alleviate  symptoms   
 depending on the severity  oxygen therapy  intravenous fluids  and  breathing  support may be required  
 the use of steroids may worsen outcomes  
 several compounds that were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19  
 the  WHO  also stated that some  traditional and home remedies  can provide relief of the  symptoms  caused by SARS-CoV-19  
 increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the  WHO  as a fundamental  outbreak  response measure  
 the ECDC and the European regional office of the  WHO  have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels  including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing  cancelling elective procedures whenever possible  separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients  and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available  ventilators  and beds  
 there are various theories about where the very first case  the so-called patient zero  may have originated  
 the first known case of the  novel Coronavirus  may trace back to 1 December 2019 in  Wuhan    Hubei   China  
 within a month  the number of  Coronavirus cases  in  Hubei  gradually increased  
 these were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market  which also sold live animals  and one theory is that the  virus  came from one of these kinds of animals  or  in other words  has a zoonotic originA  pneumonia  cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in  Hubei  Provincial Hospital  who informed the  Wuhan  Jianghan  CDC  on 27 December  
 on 30 December  a group of doctors at  Wuhan  Central Hospital alerted their colleagues of a  SARS-like  Coronavirus    
 eight of these doctors  including Li Wenliang  were admonished by the police for  spreading  false rumours  and another  Ai Fen  was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm  
 the  Wuhan  Municipal Health Commission later released a public notice on 31 December and informed the  WHO   
 enough cases of unknown  pneumonia  had been reported to health authorities in  Wuhan  to trigger an investigation in early JanuaryDuring the early stages of the  outbreak   the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days  
 in early and mid-January 2020  the  virus spread  to other Chinese provinces  helped by the Chinese New Year migration and  Wuhan  being a transport hub and major rail interchange  
 on 20 January  China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day  including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen  
 later official data shows that 6174 people had already developed  symptoms  by 20 January 2020As of 26 March  the United States has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of  confirmed cases  in the worldAs of 9 April 2020  more than 161 million cases have been reported worldwide  more than 97000 people have died and more than 364000 have recovered  
 around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case  
 due to the  pandemic  in Europe  many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls  
 national reactions have included containment measures such as  quarantines   known as stay-at-home orders  shelter-in-place orders  or  lockdown   and curfewsAs of 2 April  nearly 300 million people  or about 90  of the population  are under some form of  lockdown  in the United States  more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines  about 59 million people are in lockdown in South Africa  and 13 billion people are in lockdown in India  
 on 26 March  17 billion people worldwide were under some form of  lockdown   which increased to 26 billion people two days later — around a third of the world 's population  
 the first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to 1 December 2019 in  Wuhan   one unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 November  
 doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of  pneumonia  cases of unknown cause on 26 December  upon which her hospital informed  Wuhan  Jianghan  CDC  on 27 December  
 initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like  Coronavirus   
 a public notice was released by  Wuhan  Municipal Health Commission on 31 December  
 the  WHO  was informed on the same day  
 as these notifications occurred  doctors in  Wuhan  were warned by police for   spreading  rumours  about the  outbreak   
 the Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no  clear evidence  of human-to-human  transmission   
 in late January  the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a  people 's war  to contain the  spread  of the  virus   
 in what has been described as  the largest  quarantine  in human history   a cordon sanitaire was announced on 23 January stopping travel in and out of  Wuhan   which was extended to a total of 15 cities in  Hubei   affecting a total of about 57 million people  
 private vehicle use was banned in the city  
 Chinese New Year  25 January  celebrations were cancelled in many places  
 the authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital  Huoshenshan Hospital  which was completed in 10 days  
 another hospital was built afterwards  Leishenshan Hospital  to handle additional patients  
 in addition to newly constructed hospitals  China also converted 14 other facilities in  Wuhan   such as convention centers and stadiums  into temporary hospitalsOn 26 January  the government instituted further measures to contain the  COVID-19 outbreak   including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday  
 universities and schools around the country were also closed  
 the regions of Hong Kong and Macau instituted several measures  particularly in regard to schools and universities  
 remote working measures were instituted in several Chinese regions  
  travel restrictions  were enacted in and outside of  Hubei   
 public transport was modified  and museums throughout China were temporarily closed  
 control of public movement was applied in many cities  and it has been estimated that about 760 million people  more than half the population  faced some form of outdoor restrictionAfter the  outbreak  entered its global phase in March  Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the  virus  from  importing  from other countries  
 for example  Beijing has imposed a 14-day  mandatory quarantine  for all international travellers entering the cityOn 23 March  mainland China only one case had transmitted domestically in the five days prior  in this instance via a traveller returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul  
 on 24 March 2020  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the  spread  of domestically transmitted cases has been basically blocked and the  outbreak  has been controlled in China  
 the same day  travel restrictions  were eased in  Hubei   apart from  Wuhan   two months after the  lockdown  was imposedThe Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards  with no specific details on when this policy will end  
 those who wish to enter China will have to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates  
 the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to re-open on 30 March  and provided monetary stimulus packages for firmsThe State Council declared a day of mourning to begin with a national three-minute moment of silence on 10  00 4 April  coinciding with Qingming Festival  although the central government asked families to pay their respects online in observance of physical distancing as to avoid a renewed  COVID-19 outbreak   
 COVID-19 was confirmed to have  spread  to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China  
 the nation 's health agency reported a significant increase in  confirmed cases  on 20 February  largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus  
 Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from  Wuhan  were suspected to be the origin of the  outbreak   
 as of 22 February  among 9336 followers of the church  1261 or about 13  reported symptomsSouth Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020  
 on 28 February  more than 2000  confirmed cases  were reported in Korea  rising to 3150 on 29 February  
 all South Korean military bases were  quarantined  after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the  virus   
 airline schedules were also affected and therefore they were changedSouth Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organized programme in the world to screen the population for the  virus   and isolate any  infected  people as well as tracing and  quarantining  those who contacted them  
 screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of  symptoms  by new international arrivals through mobile application  drive-thru testing for the  virus  with the results available the next day  and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20000 people to be tested every day  
 South Korea 's programme is considered to be a success in controlling the  outbreak  despite not  quarantining  entire citiesThe South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae-in 's response to the crisis  
 many Koreans signed petitions either calling for the impeachment of Moon over what they claimed to be government mishandling of the  outbreak   or praising his response  
 on 23 March  it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks  
 on 29 March it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be  quarantined  for two weeks  
 per media reports on 1 April  South Korea has received requests for  virus  testing assistance from 121 different countries  
 Iran reported its first  confirmed cases  of  SARS-CoV-2   infections  on 19 February in Qom  where  according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education  two people died later that day  
 early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events  sporting events  and Friday prayers  and closures of universities  higher education institutions  and schools  
 Iran allocated five trillion rials to combat the  virus   
 President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there were no plans to  quarantine  areas affected by the  outbreak   and only individuals would be quarantined  
 plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March  although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued  
 Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020Iran became a centre of the  spread  of the  virus  after China during February  
 amidst claims of a cover-up of the extent of the  outbreak  in Iran  more than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February  indicating that the extent of the  outbreak  may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date  
 the Iranian Parliament was shut down  with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the  virus  on 3 March  
 on 12 March  the Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release the human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent  and to also temporarily release all the eligible prisoners  
 it stated that there is a greater risk of the  virus  to  spread  in closed institutions like detention centres  which also lack adequate  medical care   
 on 15 March  the Iranian government reported 100  deaths  in a single day  the most recorded in the country since the  outbreak  began  
 at least 12 sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March  
 by 23 March  Iran was experiencing 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to  Coronavirus   
 according to a  WHO  official  there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported  
 it is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country 's financial ability to respond to the  viral outbreak   
 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded economic sanctions to be eased for nations most affected by the  pandemic   including Iran  
 the  outbreak  was confirmed to have  spread  to Italy on 31 January  when two Chinese tourists tested positive for  SARS-CoV-2  in Rome  
 cases began to rise sharply  which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency  
 an unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected  starting with 16  confirmed cases  in Lombardy on 21 FebruaryOn 22 February  the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the  outbreak   including  quarantining  more than 50000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy  
 Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said   In the  outbreak  areas  entry and exit will not be provided  
 suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas   on 4 March  the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100  deaths   
 all major sporting events  including Serie A football matches  were to be held behind closed doors until April  but on 9 March  all sport was suspended completely for at least one month  
 on 11 March  Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmaciesOn 6 March  the Italian College of Anaesthesia  analgesia  Resuscitation and Intensive Care  SIAARTI  published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols that might be employed  
 on 19 March  Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related  deaths  in the world after reporting 3405 fatalities from the  pandemic   
 on 22 March  it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy  
 as of 5 April  there were 128948  confirmed cases   15887  deaths   and 21815 recoveries in Italy  with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region  
 a CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy 's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the  virus  to date may be contributing to the high  fatality rate   
 the United Kingdom 's response to the  virus  first emerged as one of the most relaxed of the affected countries  and until 18 March 2020  the British government did not impose any form of  social distancing  or mass  quarantine measures  on its citizens  
 as a result  the government received criticism for the perceived lack of pace and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the publicOn 16 March  Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement advising against all non-essential travel and social contact  suggesting people work from home where possible and avoid venues such as pubs  restaurants  and theatres  
 on 20 March  the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms were to close as soon as possible  and promised to pay up to 80  of workers ' wages to a limit of £ 2500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisisOn 23 March  the Prime Minister announced tougher  social distancing measures   banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activity to that deemed strictly necessary  
 unlike previous measures  these  restrictions  were enforceable by police through the issuing of fines and the dispersal of gatherings  
 most businesses were ordered to close  with exceptions for businesses deemed  essential   including supermarkets  pharmacies  banks  hardware shops  petrol stations  and garages  
 on 20 January  the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington in a man who had returned from  Wuhan  on 15 January  
 the White House  Coronavirus  Task Force was established on 29 January  
 on 31 January  the Trump administration declared a public health emergency  and placed  restrictions  on entry for travellers from China  
 on 28 January 2020  the  Center for Disease Control  — the leading public health institute of the US government — announced they had developed their own testing kit  
 despite doing so  the United States had a slow start in testing  which obscured the true extent of the  outbreak  at the time  
 testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February  a lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits  by academia  companies and hospitals  until the end of February  and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until early March  a doctor 's order was required thereafter   
 by 27 February  The Washington Post reported fewer than 4000 tests had been conducted in the United States  
 by 13 March  The Atlantic reported that less than 14000 tests had been conducted  
 on 22 March  the Associated Press reported   many people who have  symptoms  and a doctor 's order have waited hours or days for a test   after the first death in the United States was reported in Washington state on 29 February  Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency  an action that was soon followed by other states  
 schools in the Seattle area cancelled classes on 3 March  and by mid-March  schools across the country were shutting downOn 6 March 2020  the United States was advised of projections for the impact of the  new Coronavirus  on the country by a group of  epidemiologists  at Imperial College London  
 on the same day President Trump signed the  Coronavirus  Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act  which provided $ 83 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the  outbreak   
 corporations imposed employee  travel restrictions   cancelled conferences  and encouraged employees to work from home  
 sports events and seasons were cancelledOn 11 March  Trump announced  travel restrictions  for most of Europe  excluding the United Kingdom  for 30 days  effective 13 March  
 the following day  he expanded the  restrictions  to include the United Kingdom and Ireland  
 on 13 March  he declared a national emergency  which made federal funds available to respond to the crisis  
 beginning on 15 March  many businesses closed or reduced hours throughout the US to try to reduce the  spread  of the  virus   
 by 17 March  the  epidemic  had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of ColumbiaOn 23 March  it was reported that New York City had 10700 cases of the  Coronavirus   more than the total number of cases in South Korea  
 on 25 March  the governor said that  social distancing  seemed to be working  as estimates of case doubling slowed from 20 days to 47 days  
 as of 28 March  there were 32308  confirmed cases  in New York City  and 672 people had died from the virusOn 26 March  the United States was reported to have more confirmed  Coronavirus infection  cases than any other country in the world  including China and ItalyAs of 8 April  400335 cases have been confirmed in the United States  and 12841 people have died  
 per media reports on 30 March  US President Trump has decided to extend  social distancing  guidelines until 30 April  
 on the same day  the USNS Comfort  a hospital ship with about 1000 beds  made anchor in New York  
 on 3 April  the US had a record 884  deaths  due to the  Coronavirus  in a 24-hour period  
 in the state of New York the cases have exceeded 100000 people on 3 AprilThe White House has been criticized for downplaying the threat and controlling the messaging by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the  virus  with the office of Vice-President Mike Pence  
 overall approval of Trump 's management of the crisis has been polarized along partisan lines  
 some US officials and commentators criticized the US reliance on importation of critical materials  including essential medical supplies  from China  
 an analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict patterns of  spread  and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020  
 based on 2018 information from the International Air Transport Association  Bangkok  Hong Kong  Tokyo  and Taipei had the largest volume of travellers from  Wuhan

  laboratory testing  for the  respiratory   Coronavirus  disease 2019  COVID-19  and the associated  SARS-CoV-2   virus  includes methods that detect the presence of  virus  and those that detect antibodies produced in response to  infection   
 the presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR  which detects the  Coronavirus  '  RNA   
 this test is specific and is designed to only detect the  RNA  of the  SARS-CoV-2   virus   
 it is used to confirm very recent or active  infections   
 detection of antibodies  serology  can be used both for diagnosis and population surveillance  
 antibody tests show how many people have had the disease  including those whose  symptoms  were too minor to report or who were  asymptomatic   
 an accurate  mortality rate  of the disease and the level of herd  immunity  in the population can be determined from the results of this test  
 due to limited testing  as of March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the  virus  in their population  
 by 23 March  no country had tested more than 3  of their population  and there are massive variations in how much testing has been done across countries  
 this variability is also likely to be significantly affecting reported  case fatality rates   which are likely to be significantly over-estimated in some countries  
 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  rRT-PCR  the test can be done on  respiratory  samples obtained by various methods  including nasopharyngeal  swab  or  sputum  sample  
 results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days  
 the RT-PCR test performed with throat swabs is only reliable in the first week of the disease  
 later on the  virus  can disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the  lungs   
 for  infected  people tested in the second week  alternatively sample material can then be taken from the deep airways by suction catheter or  coughing  up material   sputum   can be used  
 one of the early PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  rRT-PCR   and formed the basis of 250000 kits for distribution by the  World Health Organization    WHO    
 the United Kingdom had also developed a test by 23 January 2020The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical grade  PCR-based  SARS-CoV-2  detection kit  PowerChek  Coronavirus   on 28 January 2020  
 it looks for the  E  gene shared by all beta coronaviruses  and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2In China  BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China 's National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based  SARS-CoV-2  detection kitIn the United States  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   CDC   is distributing its 2019-Novel  Coronavirus    2019-nCoV   Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health labs through the International Reagent Resource  
 one of three genetic tests in older versions of the  test kits  caused inconclusive results due to faulty  reagents   and a bottleneck of testing at the  CDC  in Atlanta  this resulted in an average of fewer than 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout the whole of February 2020  
 tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020  and it was not until then that state and local laboratories were permitted to begin testing  
 the test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use AuthorizationUS commercial labs began testing in early March 2020  
 as of 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced nationwide availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR  
 quest Diagnostics similarly made nationwide COVID-19 testing available as of 9 March 2020  
 no quantity limitations were announced  specimen collection and processing must be performed according to  CDC  requirements  
 in Russia  the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology vector  
 on 11 February 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in HealthcareOn 12 March 2020  Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infectionOn 13 March 2020  Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test which could be performed within 35 hours in high volume  thus allowing one machine to do approximately 4128 tests in a 24-hour period  
 on 19 March 2020  the FDA issued emergency use authorization  EUA  to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott 's m2000 system  the FDA had previously issued similar authorization to Hologic  LabCorp  and Thermo Fisher Scientific  
 on 21 March 2020  Cepheid similarly received EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes  
 the FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR  
 since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles this method can deliver positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes  
 there are currently about 18000 of these machines in the US and Abbott expects to ramp up manufacturing to deliver 50000 tests per dayA test which uses a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein  N protein  of the  novel Coronavirus  is being developed in Taiwan  with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes just like a rapid  influenza  test  
 a March 2020 literature review concluded that  chest radiographs are of little diagnostic value in early stages  whereas CT [ computed tomography ] findings may be present even before  symptom   onset    
 typical features on CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacificities with a peripheral  asymmetric and posterior distribution  
 Subpleural dominance  crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease evolves  
 a study comparing PCR to CT in  Wuhan  at the point of origin of the  current pandemic  has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR  though less specific  with many of its imaging features overlapping with other  pneumonias  and disease processes  
 as of March 2020  the American College of Radiology recommends that  CT should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19  As of March 2020  the  CDC  recommends PCR for initial screening  
 part of the immune response to  infection  is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG  
 these can be used to detect  infection  in individuals starting 7 days or so after the  onset  of  symptoms   to determine  immunity   and in population surveillanceAssays can be performed in central laboratories  clt  or by point-of-care testing  PoCT   
 the high-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these assays but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system  
 for clt a single specimen of peripheral blood is commonly used  although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response  
 for PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture  
 unlike PCR methods an extraction step is not needed before assayOn March 26  2020  the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as required and are now therefore able to distribute their antibody tests  
 as of April 7  2020  only a single test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorizationIn late March 2020  Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their  test kits   which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the  virus  in blood samples  
 the testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and therefore much faster than the conventional PCR  assay  of viral  RNA   
 the antibodies are usually  detectable  14 days after the  onset  of the infectionIn early April  the UK found none of the antibody  test kits  it purchased were sufficiently good to use  
 Hong Kong has set up a scheme where suspected patients can stay home   emergency department will give a specimen tube to the patient   they spit into it  send it back and get a test result a while afterThe British NHS has announced that it is piloting a scheme to test suspected cases at home  which removes the risk of a patient infecting others if they come to a hospital or having to disinfect an ambulance if one is usedIn drive-through testing for COVID-19 for suspected cases  a  healthcare professional  takes sample using appropriate  precautions   
 drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest  most-extensive testing of any countryIn Germany  the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March  that it had a capacity for about 12000 tests per day in the ambulatory setting and 10700 had been tested in the prior week  
 costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is ordered by a physician  
 according to the president of the Robert Koch Institute  Germany has an overall capacity for 160000 tests per week  
 as of 19 March drive in tests were offered in several large cities  
 as of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown  because only positive results are reported  
 a first lab survey revealed that as of calendar week 12  2020 a total of at least 483295 samples were tested up to and including week 12  2020 and 33491 samples  69   tested positive for SARS-CoV-2In Israel  researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously  by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample is found to be positiveIn  Wuhan  a makeshift 2000-sq-meter emergency detection laboratory named  Huo-Yan   Chinese  火眼  or  Fire Eye  in English  was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI  which can process over 10000 samples a day  
 with the construction overseen by BGI-founder Wang Jian and taking 5-days  modelling has show cases in  Hubei  would have been 47  higher and the corresponding cost of the tackling the  quarantine  would have doubled if this testing capacity hadn 't come on line  
 the  Wuhan  Laboratory has been promptly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen  Tianjin  Beijing  and Shanghai  in a total of 12 cities across China  
 by 4 March 2020 the daily throughput totals were 50000 tests per dayOpen source  multiplexed designs released by origami  assays  have been released that can test as many as 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93  assays   these balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers  
 by March  shortages and insufficient amounts of  reagent  has become a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU and UK and the US  
 this has led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 ° C  208 ° F  for 5 minutes to release  RNA  genomes for further testingOn 31 March it was announced United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for  Coronavirus  per head than any other country  and was on track to scale up the level of testing to reach the bulk of the population  
 this was through a combination of drive-through capability  and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI  based on their  Huo-Yan  emergency detection laboratories in China   
 constructed in 14 days  the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to be operational outside of China  
 different testing recipes targeting different parts of the  Coronavirus  genetic profile were developed in China  France  Germany  Hong Kong  Japan  and the United States  
 the  World Health Organization  adopted the German recipe for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own  
 the German recipe was published on 17 January 2020  the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January  delaying available tests in the USChina and the United States had problems with the reliability of  test kits  early in the  outbreak   and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to satisfy demand and recommendations for testing by health experts  
 in contrast  experts say South Korea 's broad availability of testing helped reduce the  spread  of the  novel Coronavirus   
 testing capacity  largely in private sector labs  was built up over several years by the South Korean government  
 on 16 March  the  World Health Organization  called for ramping up the testing programmes as the best way to slow the advance of COVID-19 pandemicHigh demand for testing due to wide  spread  of the  virus  caused backlogs of hundreds of thousands of tests at private US labs  and supplies of swabs and chemical  reagents  became strained  
 in March 2020 China reported problems with accuracy in their  test kits   
 in the United States  the  test kits  developed by the  CDC  had  flaws   the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testingSpain purchased  test kits  from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd  but found that results were inaccurate  
 the firm explained that the incorrect results may be a result of a failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly  
 the Spanish ministry said it will withdraw the kits that returned incorrect results  and would replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy80  of  test kits  the Czech Republic purchased from China gave wrong resultsSlovakia purchased 12 million test kits from China which were found to be inaccurate  
 Prime Minister Matovič suggested these be dumped into the DanubeAteş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said the  test kits  Turkey purchased from China had a  high error rate  and did not  put them into use   the UK purchased 35 million  test kits  from China but in early April 2020 announced these were not usable  
 testing  followed with  quarantine  of those who tested positive and tracing of those with whom the  SARS-CoV-2  positive people had had contact  resulted in positive outcomes  
 researchers working in the Italian town of Vò  the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy  conducted two rounds of testing on the entire population of about 3400 people  about ten days apart  
 about half the people testing positive had no  symptoms   and all discovered cases were  quarantined   
 with travel to the commune restricted  this eliminated new  infections  completely  
 with aggressive contact tracing  inbound  travel restrictions   testing  and quarantining  the  2020 Coronavirus   pandemic  in Singapore has proceeded much more slowly than in other developed countries  but without extreme  restrictions  like forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments  
 many events have been cancelled  and Singapore did start advising residents to stay at home on 28 March  but schools reopened on time after holiday break on 23 March  
 several other countries have also managed the  pandemic  with aggressive contact tracing  inbound  travel restrictions   testing  and quarantining  but with less aggressive lock-downs  such as Iceland and South Korea  
 a statistical study has found that countries that have tested more  relative to the number of  deaths   have much lower  case fatality rates   probably because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild or no  symptoms   
 who recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16  WHO  reference laboratories for confirmatory testing  
 out of the 16 reference laboratories  7 are in Asia  5 in Europe  2 in Africa  1 in North America and 1 in Australia  
 in the following chart  the column “ Positive as  of tests ” is influenced by the country 's testing policy  
 a country that only tests people admitted to hospitals will have a higher positive as  of tests than a country that tests all citizens  whether or not they are showing  symptoms   other things being equal  




 hand washing  or handwashing   also known as hand  hygiene   is the act of cleaning one 's hands for the purpose of removing soil  grease  microorganisms  or other unwanted substances  
 hand washing with soap consistently at certain  critical moments  during the day prevents the  spread  of many diseases  for example diarrhoea and cholera  which are transmitted through fecal – oral route  
 people can also become  infected  with  respiratory diseases  such as  influenza  or the  common cold   for example  if they do not wash their hands before  touching  their eyes  nose  or mouth  ie  mucous membranes   
 the five critical moments during the day where  washing hands  with soap is important include  before and after defecation  after cleaning a child 's bottom or changing nappies  before feeding a child  before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat  fish  or poultry  
 if water and soap are not available  hands can be cleaned with ashThe  World Health Organization  recommends  washing hands   
 before  during  and after preparing food  
 before and after caring for a sick person  
 after changing the diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet  
 after blowing your nose   coughing  or  sneezing   
 after  touching  animal  animal feed  or animal waste  
 medical hand  hygiene  refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures  
 hand washing before administering  medicine  or  medical care  can prevent or minimize the  spread  of disease  
 the main medical purpose of  washing hands  is to cleanse the hands of  pathogens   bacteria  viruses  or other microorganisms that can cause disease  and chemicals which can cause harm or diseases  
 this is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field  but also an important practice for the general public  
 hand washing has many health benefits  including minimizing the  spread  of  influenza    Coronavirus   and other  infectious  diseases  preventing  infectious  causes of diarrhea  decreasing  respiratory   infections   
 and reducing infant  mortality rate  at home birth deliveries  
 a 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to small improvements in the length growth in children under five years of age  
 in developing countries  childhood  mortality rates  related to  respiratory  and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes  such as hand washing with soap  
 this simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50   
 interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third  and this is comparable to providing clean water in low income areas  
 48  of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soapHand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute  respiratory   infections   ARI   as automatic behavior performed in homes  schools  and communities worldwide  
  pneumonia   a major ARI  is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old  taking the lives of an estimated 18 million children per year  
 diarrhea and  pneumonia  together account for almost 35 million child  deaths  annually  
 according to UNICEF  turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any single  vaccine  or medical intervention  cutting  deaths  from diarrhea by almost half and  deaths  from acute  respiratory   infections  by one-quarter  
 hand washing is usually integrated together with other sanitation interventions as part of water  sanitation and  hygiene   WASH  programmes  
 hand washing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct  physical contact   
 a small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin  
 a 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy  flaky skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis  which is especially common among health-care workers  
 too frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the  symptoms  of obsessive-compulsive disorder  OCD   
 there are five critical times during the day where  washing hands  with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral  transmission  of disease  after using the bathroom  urination  defecation   after cleaning a child 's bottom  changing nappies   before feeding a child  before eating and before  after preparing food or handling raw meat  fish  or poultry  
 other occasions when correct handwashing technique should be practiced in order to prevent the  transmission  of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound  after  sneezing    coughing   or blowing your nose  after  touching  animal waste or handling animals  and after  touching  garbage  
 in many countries  there is a low rate of hand washing with soap  
 a study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average  387  of households practiced hand washing with soapA 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent  the United States near the middle with 77 percent  and China with the lowest rate of 23 percentSeveral behaviour change methodologies now exist to increase uptake of the behaviour of hand washing with soap at the critical timesGroup hand washing for school children at set times of the day is one option in developing countries to engrain hand washing in children 's behaviors  
 the  Essential Health Care Program  implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of at scale action to promote children 's health and education  
 deworming twice a year  supplemented with washing hands daily with soap  brushing teeth daily with fluoride  is at the core of this national program  
 it has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia  
 removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or  detergents  to water  
 the main action of soaps and  detergents  is to reduce barriers to solution  and increase solubility  
 water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins  which are components of organic soil  are not readily dissolved in water  
 cleansing is  however  aided by a reasonable flow of water  
 solid soap  because of its reusable nature  may hold bacteria acquired from previous uses  
 a small number of studies which have looked at the bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded transfer is unlikely as the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam  
 the  CDC  still states  liquid soap with hands-free controls for dispensing is preferable   
 antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public  
 to date  there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or  disinfectants  selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature  
 however  antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as Triclosan  which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms  
 so  even if antibiotic resistant strains aren 't selected for by antibacterial soaps  they might not be as effective as they are marketed to be  
 besides the surfactant and skin-protecting agent  the sophisticated formulations may contain acids  acetic acid  ascorbic acid  lactic acid  as pH regulator  antimicrobially active benzoic acid and further skin conditioners  aloe vera  vitamins  menthol  plant extracts  a comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that plain soaps are as effective as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps containing Triclosan in preventing  illness  and removing bacteria from the hands  
 hot water that is comfortable for  washing hands  is not hot enough to kill bacteria  
 bacteria grow much faster at body temperature  37 ° C   
 however  warm  soapy water is more effective than cold  soapy water at removing natural oils which hold soils and bacteria  
 contrary to popular belief however  scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands  
 a  hand sanitizer  or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand  hygiene  agent  
 in the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century  alcohol rub non-water-based hand  hygiene  agents  also known as  alcohol-based  hand rubs  antiseptic hand rubs  or hand sanitizers  began to gain popularity  
 most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer  polymer of acrylic acid  into a gel  or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid  or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol  
 adding diluted hydrogen-peroxide increases further the antimicrobial activityHand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95  alcohol are efficient germ killers  
 alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria  multi-drug resistant bacteria  MRSA and VRE   tuberculosis  and some viruses  including  HIV   herpes  RSV  rhinovirus  vaccinia   influenza   and hepatitis  and fungi  
 alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70  alcohol kill 9997   35 log reduction  similar to 35 decibel reduction  of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 9999  to 99999   4 to 5 log reduction  of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after applicationHand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses  
 alcohol-based  hand sanitizers  are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus  or Norwalk  type viruses  the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritisEnough hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands  
 the front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid  foam or gel is dry  
 finger tips must be washed well too  rubbing them in both palmsThe US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing over  hand sanitizer  rubs  particularly when hands are visibly dirty  
 the increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms  however  they should not serve as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable  
 frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and  or skin moisturizers are added to the formula  
 the drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and  or other emollients to the formula  
 in  clinical trials   alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial  detergents   
 allergic contact dermatitis  contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur  
 the lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing  
 despite their effectiveness  non-water agents do not cleanse the hands of organic material  but simply disinfect them  
 it is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the  spread  of many  pathogens   since the pathogens still remain on the hands  
 alcohol-free  hand sanitizer  efficacy is heavily dependent on the ingredients and formulation  and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs  
 more recently  formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application  unlike alcohol  which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use  probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions  
 many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead  
 ash or soil may be more effective than water alone  but may be less effective than soap  
 one concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the  spread  of disease rather than decrease it  
 like soap  ash is also a disinfecting agent because in contact with water  it forms an alkaline solution  
 who recommended ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available  
 correct handwashing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for prevention of  transmission  of disease includes the following steps  
 wet hands with warm or cold running water  
 running water is recommended because standing basins may be contaminated  while the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference  
 lather hands by rubbing them with a generous amount of soap  including the backs of hands  between fingers  and under nails  
 soap lifts germs from the skin  and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when soap is used rather than water alone  
 scrub for at least 20 seconds  
 scrubbing creates friction  which helps remove germs from skin  and scrubbing for longer periods removes more germs  
 rinse well under running water  
 rinsing in a basin can recontaminate hands  
 dry with a clean towel or allow to air dry  
 wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminatedThe most commonly missed areas are the thumb  the wrist  the areas between the fingers  and under fingernails  
 artificial nails and chipped nail polish may harbor microorganisms  
 moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep the hands from drying out  dry skin can lead to skin damage which can increase the risk for the  transmission  of  infection   
 various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where tap-water and  or soap is not available eg pouring water from a hanging jerrycan or gourd with suitable holes and  or using ash if needed in developing countriesIn situations with limited water supply  such as schools or rural areas in developing countries   there are water-conserving solutions  such as  tippy-taps  and other low-cost options  
 a tippy-tap is a simple technology using a jug suspended by a rope  and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap  
 effective drying of the hands is an essential part of the hand  hygiene  process  but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public washrooms  
 a growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms  
 in 2008  a study was conducted by the University of Westminster  London  and sponsored by the paper-towel industry the European Tissue Symposium  to compare the levels of  hygiene  offered by paper towels  warm-air hand dryers and the more modern jet-air hand dryers  
 after washing and drying hands with the warm-air dryer  the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the finger pads by 194  and on the palms by 254   
 drying with the jet-air dryer resulted in an increase on average of the total number of bacteria on the finger pads by 42  and on the palms by 15   
 after washing and drying hands with a paper towel  the total number of bacteria was reduced on average on the finger pads by up to 76  and on the palms by up to 77  The scientists also carried out tests to establish whether there was the potential for cross contamination of other washroom users and the washroom environment as a result of each type of drying method  
 the jet-air dryer  which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of 180 m  s  650 km  h  400 mph   was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away  
 use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 025 metres from the dryer  
 paper towels showed no significant  spread  of micro-organismsIn 2005  in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt  different hand drying methods were evaluated  
 the following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed  
 many different hand dryer manufacturers exist  and hand driers have been compared against drying with paper towels  
 hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative during traveling in the absence of soap and water  
 alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60  alcohol  
 medical  hand-washing  became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness  in 1846  in preventing disease in a hospital environment  
 there are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget  
 one study has found decreased  infection  rates with their use  
 medical hand-washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds  using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands  
 hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking  
 if there is debris under fingernails  a bristle brush may be used to remove it  
 since germs may remain in the water on the hands  it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel  
 after drying  the paper towel should be used to turn off the water  and open any exit door if necessary   
 this avoids re-contaminating the hands from those  surfaces   
 the purpose of  hand-washing  in the health-care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms   germs   and avoid transmitting them  
 the New England Journal of Medicine reports that a lack of  hand-washing  remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments  with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before  touching  patients  thus transmitting microorganisms  
 one study showed that proper  hand-washing  and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream  infections  by 66 percentThe  World Health Organization  has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in health-care sectors  
 the draft guidance of hand  hygiene  by the organization can also be found at its website for public comment  
 a relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al  
 commercial devices can measure and validate hand  hygiene   if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required  
 the  World Health Organization  has  Five Moments  for  washing hands   
 after  exposure  to blood  body fluids 
 before an aseptic task  and 
 after patient careThe addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap   medicated  or  antimicrobial  soaps  confers killing action to a  hand-washing  agent  
 such killing action may be desired prior to performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalentTo ' scrub ' one 's hands for a surgical operation  it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without  touching  it with the hands  some chlorhexidine or iodine wash  sterile towels for drying the hands after washing  and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails  
 all jewelry should be removed  
 this procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow  usually 2 – 6 minutes  
 long scrub-times  10 minutes  are not necessary  
 when rinsing  water on the forearms must be prevented from running back to the hands  
 after  hand-washing  is completed  the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is donned  
 to reduce the  spread  of germs  it is better to wash the hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after tending to a sick person  
 for control of staphylococcal  infections  in hospitals  it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand-cleansing came from the first 20  of washing  and that very little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35   
 washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial  infectious  disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soapComparing hand-rubbing with  alcohol-based  solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26  more than the antibacterial soap  
 but soap and water is more effective than  alcohol-based  hand rubs for reducing  H1N1   influenza  A  virus  and Clostridium difficile spores from handsInterventions to improve hand  hygiene  in healthcare settings can involve education for staff on hand washing  increasing the availability of  alcohol-based  hand rub  and written and verbal reminders to staff  
 there is a need for more research into which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings  
 in developing countries  hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective  essential tool for achieving good health  and even good nutrition  
 however  a lack of reliable water supply  soap or hand washing facilities in people 's homes  at schools and at the workplace make it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviors  
 for example  in most of rural Africa hand washing taps close to every private or public toilet are scarce  even though cheap options exist to build hand washing stations  
 however  low hand washing rates rather can also be the result of engrained habits rather than due to a lack of soap or water  
 the promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions  raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavior change of the population  
 for this to work effectively  monitoring and evaluation are necessary  
 a systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs  while social marketing campaigns are less effectiveOne example for hand washing promotion in schools is the  Three Star Approach  by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple  inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap  among other hygienic requirements  
 when minimum standards are achieved  schools can move from one to ultimately three stars  
 building hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality  
 global Hand washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to achieve behavior changeAs a result of the 2019-20  Coronavirus pandemic   UNICEF promoted the adoption of a handwashing emoji  
 few studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relationship to DALYs averted  
 however  one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions  
 the importance of hand washing for human health – particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid 19th century by two pioneers of hand  hygiene   the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna  Austria and Florence Nightingale  the English  founder of modern nursing   
 at that time most people still believed that  infections  were caused by foul odors called miasmas  
 in the 1980s  foodborne  outbreaks  and healthcare-associated infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand  hygiene  as an important way to prevent the  spread  of  infection   
 the  outbreak  of  swine flu  in 2009 and the  COVID-19 pandemic  in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of  washing hands  with soap to protect oneself from such  infectious  diseases  
 for example  posters with  correct hand washing techniques  were hung up next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany  
 the phrase  washing one 's hands of  something  means declaring one 's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or share complicity in it  
 it originates from the bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ  but has become a phrase with a much wider usage in some English communities  
 in Shakespeare 's Macbeth  Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imagined stain  representing her guilty conscience regarding crimes she had committed and induced her husband to commit  
 it has also been found that people  after having recalled or contemplated unethical acts  tend to wash hands more often than others  and tend to value hand washing equipment more  
 furthermore  those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a contemplation are less likely to engage in other  cleansing  compensatory actions  such as volunteering  
 religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposesSymbolic hand washing  using water but no soap to wash hands  is a part of ritual hand washing featured in many religions  including Bahá 'í Faith  Hinduism  tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism  Lavabo in Christianity  and Wudhu in IslamReligions also prescribe hygienic hand washing  especially after certain actions  
 Hinduism  Judaism and Islam mandate washing of hands after using the toilet  
 and  Hinduism  Buddhism  Sikhism  Judaism and Islam mandate washing of hands before and after every meal  




 workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 
 workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard controls to the prevention of  Coronavirus disease  2019  COVID-19   
 the proper hazard controls in the workplace depend on the worksite and job task  based on a risk assessment of sources of  exposure   disease severity in the community  and risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19  
 according to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA   lower  exposure  risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers  for which basic  infection  prevention measures are recommended  including hand washing  encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick   respiratory  etiquette  and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment  
 medium  exposure  risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected with COVID-19  but may  be infected  due to ongoing  community transmission  or  international travel   
 this includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools  high-population-density work environments  and some high-volume retail settings  
 hazard controls for this group  in addition to basic  infection  prevention measures  include  ventilation  using high-efficiency air filters  sneeze guards  and having  personal protective equipment  available in case a person with COVID-19 is encountered  
 OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high  exposure  risk  which increases to very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on  or collect or handle specimens from  known or suspected person with COVID-19  
 hazard controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure  ventilation  rooms  and  personal protective equipment  appropriate to the job task  
 COVID-19  outbreaks  can have several effects within the workplace  
 workers may be absent from work due to becoming sick  needing to care for others  or from fear of possible  exposure   
 patterns of commerce may change  both in terms of what goods are demanded  and the means of acquiring these goods  such as shopping at off-peak hours or through delivery or drive-through services   
 lastly  shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interruptedAn  infectious  disease  preparedness  and response plan can be used to guide protective actions  
 plans address the levels of risk associated with various worksites and job tasks  including sources of  exposure   risk factors arising from home and community settings  and risk factors of individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions  
 they also outline controls necessary to address those risks  and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of  outbreaks   
  infectious  disease  preparedness  and response plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations  
 objectives for response to an  outbreak  include reducing  transmission  among staff  protecting people who are at higher risk for adverse health complications  maintaining business operations  and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains  
 the disease severity in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken  
 the hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls by effectiveness  
 where COVID-19 hazards cannot be eliminated  the most effective controls are engineering controls  followed by administrative controls  and lastly  personal protective equipment   
 engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior  and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement  
 administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer  
  personal protective equipment   PPE  is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls  but can help prevent some  exposures   
 all types of PPE must be selected based upon the hazard to the worker  properly fitted as applicable  eg  respirators   consistently and properly worn  regularly inspected  maintained  and replaced  as necessary  and properly removed  cleaned  and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination  
 according to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA   lower  exposure  risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers  
 basic  infection  prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing  encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick   respiratory  etiquette including covering  coughs  and  sneezes   providing tissues and trash receptacles  preparing for telecommuting or staggered shifts if needed  discouraging workers from using others ' tools and equipment  and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment  
 prompt identification and  isolation  of potentially  infectious  individuals is a critical step in protecting workers  customers  visitors  and others at a worksite  
 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   CDC   recommends that employees who have  symptoms  of acute  respiratory illness  are to stay home until they are free of  fever   signs of a  fever   and any other  symptoms  for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering  medicines   and that sick leave policies are flexible  permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member  and that employees are aware of these policies  
 according to OSHA  medium  exposure  risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet  18 m  of people who are not known or suspected COVID-19 patients  but may  be infected  with  SARS-CoV-2  due to ongoing  community transmission  around the business location  or because the individual has recent  international travel  to a location with widespread COVID-19  transmission   
 these include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools  high-population-density work environments  and some high-volume retail settingsEngineering controls for this and higher risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters  increasing  ventilation  rates  installing physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards  and installing a drive-through window for customer serviceAdministrative controls for this and higher risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home  replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications  establishing staggered shifts  discontinuing nonessential travel to locations with ongoing COVID-19  outbreaks   developing emergency communications plans including a forum for answering workers ’ concerns  providing workers with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors  training workers who need to use protecting clothing and equipment how to use it  providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal  hygiene   requiring regular hand washing  limiting customers ' and the public 's access to the worksite  and posting signage about hand washing and other COVID-19 protective measuresDepending on the work task  workers with at least medium  exposure  risk may need to wear  personal protective equipment  including some combination of gloves  a gown  a face shield or  face mask   or goggles  
 workers in this risk group rarely require use of respirators  
 if a person becomes sick on an airplane  proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet  designating one crew member to serve the sick person  and offering a  face mask  to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when  coughing  or  sneezing   
 cabin crew should wear  disposable  medical gloves when tending to a sick traveler or  touching  body fluids or potentially contaminated  surfaces   and possibly additional  personal protective equipment  if the sick traveler has  fever   persistent  cough   or  difficulty breathing   
 gloves and other  disposable  items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag  and contaminated  surfaces  should be cleaned and disinfected afterwardsFor commercial shipping  including cruise ships and other passenger vessels  hazard controls include postponing travel when sick  and self-isolating and informing the onboard medical center immediately if one develops a  fever  or other  symptoms  while on board  
 ideally  medical follow-up should occur in the isolated person 's cabinFor schools and childcare facilities   CDC  recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an  infected  person has been in a school building regardless of  community spread   
 when there is minimal to moderate  community transmission    social distancing  strategies can be implemented such as canceling field trips  assemblies  and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria  increasing the space between desks  staggering arrival and dismissal times  limiting nonessential visitors  and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like  symptoms   
 when there is substantial  transmission  in the local community  in addition to  social distancing  strategies  extended school dismissals may be consideredFor law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities  the immediate health risk is considered low by  CDC   
 law enforcement officials who must make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians  including proper  personal protective equipment   
 if  close contact  occurs during apprehension  workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe  and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for containing and laundering clothes  
 OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high categories of  exposure  risk  
 high  exposure  risk jobs include healthcare delivery  support  laboratory  and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients  
 these become very high  exposure  risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on  or collect or handle specimens from  known or suspected COVID-19 patients  
 aerosol-generating procedures include  intubation    cough  induction procedures  bronchoscopies  some dental procedures and exams  or invasive specimen collection  
 high  exposure  risk mortuary jobs include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people who had known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death  these become very high  exposure  risk if they perform an autopsyAdditional engineering controls for these risk groups include  isolation  rooms for patients with known or suspected COVID-19  including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed  
 specialized negative pressure  ventilation  may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary settings  
 specimens should be handled with Biosafety Level 3  precautions   
 the  World Health Organization    WHO   recommends that incoming patients be separated into distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 caseIn addition to other PPE  OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of patients known to be  or suspected of being   infected  with  SARS-CoV-2   and those performing aerosol-generating procedures  
 in the United States  NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive  written  respiratory  protection program that includes fit-testing  training  and medical exams  
 other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfortThe  WHO  does not recommend coveralls  as COVID-19 is a  respiratory disease  rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids  
 who recommends only a surgical mask for point-of-entry screening personnel  
 for those who are collecting  respiratory  specimens from  caring for  or transporting COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures   WHO  recommends a surgical mask  goggles  or face shield  gown  and gloves  
 if an aerosol-generating procedure is performed  the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator  
 given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient   WHO  recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine  physical barriers such as clear windows  allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient  using only the PPE necessary for the specific task  continuing use of the same  respirator  without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis  monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain  and discouraging the use of  masks  for  asymptomatic  individuals

 we find ourselves in remarkable circumstances this month  
 the  COVID-19 epidemic  is something that makes clear our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have to one another  
 we don ’ t have precedent for its challenges  but we do know that our best response relies on the sort of global empathy  cooperation  and community building that sits at the heart of this organization  
 the camaraderie and care we have seen among all of our colleagues over email  calls  and chats is a remarkable validation of the incredible humans we are fortunate enough to work with  
 I couldn ’ t be more grateful and proud to count you all as colleagues  
 last week  someone shared with me their appreciation for our work  
 they reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now  and what a powerful symbol it is for this critical resource to remain online and available to all  
 your work makes this possible  whether you keep the sites stay up or our colleagues paid or our communities safe  
 the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides  now more than ever  
 this is a moment in which not only what we do  but how we do it  will make a meaningful impact on the world  
 because of the importance of this mission and your role in it  we will be making some significant adjustments to how we work together  starting this coming week  
 adjustments to our work and schedules 
 as Robyn mentioned previously  the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months  
 in that conversation  we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we ’ re facing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this time  
 overwhelmingly we wanted to remove stress and support our mission for the long term  
 if you need to dial back  that ’ s okay  
 for all staff  contractors  and contract workers  
 our daily working expectations will be about 4 hours a day  or 20 hours a week until further notice  
 we ’ re not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work more normal hours  the mission can use you  
 however  the world is unpredictable right now  and whether you need to care for loved ones  get groceries  or go to the doctor  your well-being is our priority  
 we are not tracking your time  
 if you are sick  do not work  
 this should go without saying  but we ’ re saying it  
 no sick days or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered  
  if you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19  please let Bryan within T & C Ops know so T & C can help with support and make sure your situation gets appropriate attention from management   
 hourly folks will be fully paid  
 we have already said  and are recommitting to honor our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues  
 everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual hours worked during normal circumstances  
 this includes if you are sick and unable to work  
 if you want to work  we support you  
 many people use work as a way of channeling their stress with the world around us  
 what we do can be incredibly rewarding  especially during times like this  
 again  this is about your self-care  
 our ask is that you communicate with your manager  so we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly  
 some work is considered essential  
 there are some things that we must keep doing  
 the SRE  HR Ops  Trust & Safety  and Fundraising teams  among others  do critical work that may need additional support  
 we ’ ll begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what ’ s essential for our mission  
 there ’ s plenty to do for all of us  we just will all focus on the most essential projects  
 slowing now won ’ t hurt later  
 we do not plan to go “ double-time to catch up ” once the  pandemic  has passed  
 you will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines which are now unrealistic  
 we accept that circumstances have changed  and will work to set new targets and timelines where appropriate  
 what happens with the APP  Annual Planning   
 to adjust to our new reality and daily working hour expectations  we intend to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan  
 our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgeting to allow employees to prioritize critical work  self-care  and care for loved ones while accommodating those who need or wish to work a reduced schedule over the next few weeks  
 this timeline extension greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the whole organization  
 we will introduce our proposal to the Board next week and will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation  
 thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this  
 Office status   exposure   and cleaning 
 last week  we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the  COVID-19 virus   
 however  out of an abundance of caution  we employed an antiviral cleaning crew to disinfect all  surfaces  in the San Francisco office  
 they utilized a hospital-grade anti-viral solution to disinfect every  surface   as well as the lobby and elevator banks accessing our floor  
 the building is employing its own duty-of-care protocol utilizing products that support the safety of their tenants  
 we feel comfortable that the office will be well-prepared for when we decide to return  
 our DC office is located in a WeWork  which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members  
 as of last week  our DC office moved to a fully remote setup in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco  
 as some of our NYC-based colleagues know  we have also been in discussion about leasing a location in Brooklyn  
 these discussions are continuing but may be delayed  
 some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time  
 our long-time remote colleagues know that it can be an adjustment  and wanted to offer you some advice  
 limit the length of meetings to at most one or two hour increments  
 if longer sessions are required  consider how they can be broken up over the course of several days  
 clearly define the meeting  have an agenda  and send reading materials in advance  
 make video the default  with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection  
 have a lead to facilitate every meeting  someone to monitor the chat for questions and track the speaker list  and someone to help take notes  or do collaborative note-taking   
 send an email to tech support if you need a comfortable headset  
 use your wellness reimbursement for snacks  
 join the # remoties channel in Slack to talk with your colleagues about distributed work 
 the HR Operations team is looking into webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation  
 this past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events  such as editathons  until the  WHO  declares the  pandemic  to be over  
 we let them know that we understood that our request for cancellations and other  restrictions  could make it impossible to complete their agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify those goals  
 this coming week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences  
 the general sentiment from around the global community seems to be both sadness at the disruption but relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities  Wikimedia and otherwise  
 going forward  the CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them  
 staying in touch around COVID-19 related issues 
 we ’ ll be sending an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday  14  00 UTC  07  00 PT for a special staff meeting  
 we ’ ll use this time to share additional  updates   answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other  
 we ’ re in this together and here to help however we can  
 in the meantime  you can continue to find the information from this email  and all other essential COVID-19 related information  on Office Wiki  
 the CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place  
 we are also working to maintain regular communications with staff who reside in countries that are currently significantly affected  
 if you have any questions about travel  events  a major Workstream  or coverage challenge  or anything else you may need help with  please don ’ t hesitate to notify and work with the CRT  
 we ’ re here to help provide support and liaise as needed  
 if you have a confidential or sensitive matter  please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations  
 none of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and obligations  
 rather  they are a recognition that at this moment  our work and obligations will likely need to adapt in a way we have not in the past  
 these are the steps we believe are necessary to support this one another so that we can continue to work  provide our movement with the support they need  and the world with the service they rely on  
 our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes  
 for now  it is time to support one another and create space for the important work that will be coming in the weeks and potentially months ahead  
 we need all of you to make that happen  and so we need you all to take care of yourself and your families so that you can be at your best when the need arises  
 now  please --  wash your hands  and don ’ t  touch  your face

 b 'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  is an enzyme attached to the outer  surface   cell membranes  of cells in the  lungs   arteries  heart  kidney  and intestines  
 ACE2 counters the activity of the related ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING enzyme  ACE  by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang  1-7  making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseasesACE2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses  
 the human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2  
 ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING enzyme 2 is a zinc containing metalloenzyme located on the  surface  of endothelial and other cells  
 ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain  
 ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein  with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the  surface  of cells in  lungs  and other tissues  
 the extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase  and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and ultimately excreted into urine  
 ACE2 is present in most organs  ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of mainly lung type II alveolar cells  enterocytes of the small intestine  arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs  
 ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex  striatum  hypothalamus  and brainstem  
 the primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counter balance to ACE  
 ACE cleaves angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II  
 ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II  Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe  and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin  1-7    H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH   
 ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides including [ des-Arg9 ] -bradykinin  apelin  neurotensin  dynorphin A  and ghrelin  
 ACE2 also regulates the membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup 's disease  
 as a transmembrane protein  ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses  including HCoV-NL63   SARS-CoV   the  virus  that causes  SARS    and  SARS-CoV-2   the  virus  that causes COVID-19   
 more specifically  the binding of the spike S1 protein of  SARS-CoV  and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the  surface  of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the  virus  and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells  
 this entry process also requires priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2  the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapeuticThis has led some to hypothesize that decreasing the levels of ACE2  in cells  might help in fighting the  infection   
 however  multiple professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitor and arb therapy  
 a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11  2012  found that  use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34  reduction in risk of  pneumonia  compared with controls   
 moreover   the risk of  pneumonia  was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of  pneumonia   in particular those with stroke and  heart failure   
 use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in  pneumonia  related mortality  although the results were less robust than for overall risk of  pneumonia    
 recombinant human ACE2  rhACE2  is surmised to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury  and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with a lipopolysaccharide-induced  acute respiratory distress syndrome   
 the half-life of rhACE2 in human beings is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect  duration  of 24 hours  
 several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors  RAS inhibitors  or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevatedInfused rhACE2 has been evaluated in  clinical trials  for the treatment of  acute respiratory distress syndrome   




 b 'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to aid contact tracing in response to the 2019-20  Coronavirus pandemic   ie the process of identifying persons   contacts   who may have been in contact with an  infected  individual  
 numerous applications were developed or proposed  with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions  
 several frameworks for building contact tracing apps have been developed  
 privacy concerns have been raised  especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users  
 less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user 's proximity to other cellphones  
 on 10 April 2020  Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems  
 in China  the Chinese government  in conjunction with Alipay  has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people that have COVID-19  
 it is in use across more than 200 Chinese citiesIn Singapore  an app called TraceTogether is being used  
 the app was developed by local IT community  released as open source and will be handed over to the governmentNorth Macedonia launched  StopKorona    a Bluetooth-based app to trace  exposure  with potentially  infected  persons and provide a fast response to healthcare authorities  
 the app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and Ministry of Health  
 as of 14 April 2020  the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store  
 on 12 April  the government stated that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development  and would be available for deployment within weeksA similar app is planned in Ireland  and in France   StopCovid    
 both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore 's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocolRussia intends to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow  designed to ensure they do not leave home  
 Ross Anderson  professor of security engineering at Cambridge University  listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems  including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if takeup of the app is limited to only a small fraction of the population  
 addressing concerns about the  spread  of misleading or harmful   Coronavirus   apps  Apple set limits on which types of organizations could add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store  limiting them to only  official  or otherwise reputable organizations  
 Google and Amazon have implemented similar  restrictions   
 privacy campaigners voiced their concern regarding the implications of mass surveillance using  Coronavirus  apps  in particular about whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the  Coronavirus pandemic  will be dismantled once the threat has passed  
 Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance  
 the organisations declared eight conditions on governmental projects  
 surveillance would have to be  lawful  necessary and proportionate   
 extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have sunset clauses  
 the use of data would have to be limited to COVID-19 purposes  
 data security and anonymity would have to be protected and shown to be protected based on evidence  
 digital surveillance would have to avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation  
 any sharing of data with third parties would have to be defined in law  
 there would have to be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuses  
 meaningful participation by all  relevant stakeholders  would be required  including that of public health experts and marginalised groupsThe German Chaos Computer Club  CCC  and Reporters Without Borders  Reporter ohne Grenzen   RSF  also issued checklists  
 the proposed Google  Apple plan intends to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating systems once it is no longer needed  
 some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps  eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking  
 in Israel  network-based tracking was approved  
 network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy problems  
 however  not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data  a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication  see section below   
 in South Korea  a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing  
 instead of using a dedicated app  the system gathered tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data  and combined these to generate notices via text messages to potentially-infected individuals  
 in addition to using this information to alert potential contacts  the government has also made the location information publicly available  something permitted because of far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the MERS  outbreak  in that country  
 this information is available to the public via a number of apps and websitesCountries including Germany considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems  
 as of 6 April 2020  the details had not yet been released  
 Privacy-preserving contact tracing is a well-established concept  with a substantial body of research literature dating back to at least 2013As of 7 April 2020  over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions  such as using Bluetooth Low Energy  ble  to log a user 's proximity to other cellphones  
 however  PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort which contains both centralised and decentralised approaches  and is not a single protocolDecentralised protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing  DP-PPT  DP-3T   Temporary Contact Numbers  TCN  fka Contact Event Numbers  CEN   Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing  PACT  and others  
 in these protocols  identifiable personal data never leaves the device  and all matching happens on-device  
 the Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths  a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the  spread  of COVID-19  
 it is based on research from the WhitePaper  Apps Gone Rogue  maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic  released in March 2020Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC  a company developing privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab  
 SafeTrace utilizes secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials  without compromising the privacy of that data  
 on 5 April 2020  the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that had coalesced around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols  with the goal to reduce fragmentation  and enable global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps  a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption  
 on 9 April 2020  the Singaporean government announced that it had open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app  
 on 10 April 2020  Google and Apple  the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms  announced an initiative for contact tracing  which they claimed would preserve privacy  based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography

 b 'Drug repositioning  also known as drug repurposing  re-profiling  re-tasking or therapeutic switching  is the repurposing of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition than that for which it was originally developed  
 this is one line of scientific research which is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments  
 other research directions include the development of a COVID-19  vaccine  and convalescent plasma transfusionSARS-CoV-2 has about 66 druggable proteins  each of which has multiple ligand binding sites  
 analyzing those binding sites provide the reasonable project of developing effective  antiviral drug  against COVID-19 proteins  
 of the most important  SARS-CoV-2  target proteins are papain-like protease   RNA  dependent  RNA  polymerase  helicase  S protein  and ADP ribophosphatase

 b 'A COVID-19  vaccine  is a hypothetical  vaccine  against  Coronavirus disease  2019  COVID-19   
 although no  vaccine  has completed clinical trials  there are multiple attempts in progress to develop such a vaccine  
 in late February 2020  the  World Health Organization    WHO   said it did not expect a  vaccine  against  SARS-CoV-2   the causative  virus   to become available in less than 18 months  
 five  vaccine  candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April  
 COVID-19 was identified in December 2019  
 a major  outbreak   spread  around the world in 2020  leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop a  vaccine   
 many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible  vaccines  against  SARS-CoV-2   
 stated in April  imperatives of the CEPI initiative for  vaccine  development are speed  manufacturing capacity  deployment at scale  and global access  
 in April  CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective  vaccine  against COVID-19  
 major platform targets advanced into Phase I safety studies include  
 nucleic acid  DNA and  RNA    Phase I developer and  vaccine  candidate  Moderna  mRNA-1273  
 viral vector  Phase I developer and  vaccine  candidate  CanSino Biologics  adenovirus type 5 vector  
 as reported by CEPI scientists in April  115 total  vaccine  candidates are in early stages of development  with 78 confirmed as active projects  79  according to the Milken Institute   and 37 others announced  but with little public information available  presumed to be in planning or being designed   
 a Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing  is typically randomized  placebo-controlled  and at multiple sites  while determining more precise  effective doses  
 phase III trials typically involve more participants  including a control group  and test effectiveness of the  vaccine  to prevent the disease  while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose  
 of 79  vaccine  candidates in active development  confirmed as of early April 2020   74 were not yet in human evaluation  still in  preclinical  research   
 around 24 January 2020 in Australia  the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a molecular clamp  vaccine  that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune reaction  
 around 24 January 2020 in Canada  the International Vaccine Centre  VIDO-InterVac  at the University of Saskatchewan announced the commencement of work on a  vaccine   aiming to start human testing in 2021  
  vaccine  development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020  and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January  
 around 29 January 2020  Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies  led by Hanneke Schuitemaker  announced that it had begun work on developing a  vaccine   
 Janssen is co-developing an oral  vaccine  with its biotechnology partner  Vaxart  
 on 18 March 2020  emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the  vaccine   
 on 8 February 2020  the laboratory OncoGen in Romania published a paper on the design of a  vaccine  with similar technology to the one used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy  
 on 25 March the head of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the  vaccine  and were beginning the tests  
 on 27 February 2020  a Generex subsidiary company  NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology  announced they were beginning a  vaccine  project to create an Ii-Key peptide  vaccine  against COVID-19  
 they wanted to produce a  vaccine  candidate that could be tested in humans  within 90 days   
 on 5 March 2020  Washington University in St Louis announced its projects to develop a  vaccine   
 on 5 March 2020  the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring  both in western Maryland  announced they were working on a  vaccine   
 around 10 March 2020  emergent Biosolutions announced that it had teamed with Novavax Inc  
 in the development and manufacture of a  vaccine   
 the partners further announced plans for preclinical testing and a Phase I  clinical trial  by July 2020  
 on 12 March 2020  India 's Health Ministry announced they are working with 11 isolates  and that even on a fast track it would take at least around one-and-a-half to two years to develop a  vaccine   
 on 12 March 2020  Medicago  a biotechnology company in Quebec City  Quebec  reported development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research  
 the  vaccine  candidate is in laboratory research  with human testing planned for July or August 2020  
 earlier that week  The Guardian reported that the US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac  ' large sums of money ' for exclusive access to a Covid-19  vaccine    against which the German government protested  
 on 17 March 2020  American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based  vaccine   
 mRNA-based  vaccine  candidate BNT162  currently in pre-clinical testing with  clinical trials  expected to begin in April 2020  
 in Italy on 17 March 2020  Takis Biotech  an Italian biotech company announced they will have pre-clinical testing results in April 2020 and their final  vaccine  candidate could begin human testing by fall  
 in France on 19 March 2020  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations  CEPI  announced a US $ 49 million investment in a COVID-19  vaccine  research consortium involving the Institut Pasteur  Themis Bioscience  Vienna  Austria   and the University of Pittsburgh  bringing CEPI 's total investment in COVID-19  vaccine  development to US $ 29 million  
 CEPI 's other investment partners for COVID-19  vaccine  development are Moderna  Curevac  Inovio  Novavax  the University of Hong Kong  the University of Oxford  and the University of Queensland  
 on 20 March 2020  Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six different  vaccine  candidates  
 Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying  RNA   vaccine  for COVID-19  
 the  vaccine  candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China  
 in late March  the Canadian government announced C $ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19  including numerous  vaccine  candidates at Canadian companies and universities  such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives  
 around the same time  the Canadian government announced C $ 192 million specifically for developing a COVID-19  vaccine   with plans to establish a national  vaccine bank  of several new  vaccines  that could be used if another  Coronavirus   outbreak  occurs  
 on 2 April 2020  researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on testing of PittCoVacc  a possible COVID-19  vaccine  in mice  stating that  MNA delivered  SARS-CoV-2  S1 subunit  vaccines  elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses [ in the mice ] that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization   
 in Canada on 16 April 2020  the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced design of a DNA-based  vaccine  candidate as a possible nasal spray  
 using bacteriophages  the DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles  which may stimulate the  immune system  to produce antibodies against the  SARS-CoV-2   virus   
 in March 2020  the US government  industry  and three universities pooled resources to access supercomputers from IBM  combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise  Amazon  Microsoft  and Google  
 some  vaccines  have heterologous effects  also called non-specific effects  
 that means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent  
 a further randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enrol 4170 healthcare workers  
 it is possible  vaccines  in development will not be safe or effective  
 early research to assess  vaccine  efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal models  such as ACE2-transgenic mice  other laboratory animals  and non-human primates  indicate a need for biosafety-level 3 containment measures for handling live viruses  and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures  
  vaccines  against  SARS  and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models  
 as of 2020  there is no cure or protective  vaccine  for  SARS  that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans  
 according to research papers published in 2005 and 2006  the identification and development of novel  vaccines  and  medicines  to treat  SARS  was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the worldThere is also no proven  vaccine  against MERS  
 when MERS became prevalent  it was believed that existing  SARS  research may provide a useful template for developing  vaccines  and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV  infection   
 as of March 2020  there was one  DNA based  MERS  vaccine  which completed phase I  clinical trials  in humans  and three others in progress  all of which are viral-vectored  vaccines   two adenoviral-vectored  ChAdOx1-MERS  BVRS-GamVac   and one MVA-vectored  MVA-MERS-S   
 social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming the  virus  behind COVID-19 was known and that a  vaccine  was already available  
 the patents cited by various social media posts reference existing patents for genetic sequences and  vaccines  for other strains of  Coronavirus  such as the  SARS   Coronavirus   




 b 'Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is an  infectious  disease caused by severe acute  respiratory syndrome   Coronavirus  2   SARS-CoV-2    
 common  symptoms  include  fever    cough   and  shortness of breath   
 other  symptoms  may include fatigue  muscle pain  diarrhea   sore throat   loss of smell  and abdominal pain  
 the time from  exposure  to  onset  of  symptoms  is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days  
 while the majority of cases result in mild  symptoms   some progress to  viral pneumonia  and  multi-organ failure   
 as of 17 April 2020  more than 224 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories  resulting in more than 153000  deaths   
 more than 568000 people have recoveredThe  virus  is primarily  spread  between people during  close contact   often via small  droplets  produced by  coughing    sneezing   or talking  
 while these  droplets  are produced when breathing out  they usually fall to the ground or onto  surfaces  rather than being  infectious  over long distances  
 people may also become  infected  by  touching  a contaminated  surface  and then  touching  their eyes  nose  or mouth  
 the  virus  can survive on  surfaces  up to 72 hours  
 it is most  contagious  during the first three days after the  onset  of  symptoms   although  spread  may be possible before  symptoms  appear and in later stages of the diseaseThe standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  rRT-PCR  from a nasopharyngeal  swab   
 the use of  masks  is recommended for those who suspect they have the  virus  and their caregivers  
 recommendations for mask use by the general public vary  with some authorities recommending against their use  some recommending their use  and others requiring their use  
 currently  there is no  vaccine  or specific  antiviral treatment  for COVID-19  
 local  transmission  of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six  WHO  regions  
 those  infected  with the  virus  may be  asymptomatic  or develop flu-like  symptoms  such as  fever    cough   fatigue  and  shortness of breath   
 emergency  symptoms  include  difficulty breathing   persistent chest pain or pressure  confusion  difficulty waking  and bluish face or lips  immediate medical attention is advised if these  symptoms  are present  
 less commonly  upper  respiratory   symptoms  such as  sneezing    runny nose  or  sore throat  may be seen  
 gastrointestinal  symptoms  such as nausea  vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages  
 some cases in China initially presented only with chest tightness and palpitations  
 in some  the disease may progress to  pneumonia    multi-organ failure   and death  
 this is called  the incubation period   
  the incubation period  for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days  
 975  of people who develop  symptoms  will do so within 115 days of infectionReports indicate that not all who are  infected  develop  symptoms   
 the role of these  asymptomatic  carriers in  transmission  is not yet fully known  however  preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the  spread  of the disease  
 the proportion of  infected  people who do not display  symptoms  is currently unknown and being studied  with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  KCDC  reporting that 20  of all  confirmed cases  remained  asymptomatic  during their hospital stay  
 China 's National Health Commission began including  asymptomatic  cases in its daily cases on 1 April  of the 166  infections  on that day  130  78   were  asymptomatic  at the time of testing  
 both  sputum  and saliva can carry large viral loads  
 loud talking releases more  droplets  than normal talking  
 a study in Singapore found that an uncovered  cough  can lead to  droplets  travelling up to 45 meters  15 feet   
 though the  virus  is not generally airborne  the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol  transmission  may be possible and air collectors positioned in the hallway outside of people 's rooms yielded samples positive for viral  RNA   
 some medical procedures such as  intubation  and cardiopulmonary resuscitation  CPR  may cause  respiratory   secretions  to be aerosolised and thus result in airborne  spread   
 while there are concerns it may  spread  via feces  this risk is believed to be lowThe  virus  is most  contagious  when people are  symptomatic   while  spread  may be possible before  symptoms  emerge  the risk is low  
 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control  ECDC  says while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads  one person generally infects two to three othersThe  virus  survives for hours to days on  surfaces   
 specifically  the  virus  was found to be  detectable  for one day on cardboard  for up to three days on plastic  polypropylene  and stainless steel  AISI 304   and for up to four hours on 99  copper  
 this  however  varies depending on the humidity and temperature  
 soap and  detergent  are also effective if correctly used  soap products degrade the  virus  ' fatty protective layer  deactivating it  as well as freeing them from skin and other  surfaces   
 other solutions  such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate  a surgical  disinfectant    are less effectiveIn a Hong Kong study  saliva samples were taken a median of two days after the start of hospitalization  
 in five of six patients  the first sample showed the highest viral load  and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested  
 severe acute  respiratory syndrome   Coronavirus  2   SARS-CoV-2   is a novel severe acute  respiratory syndrome   Coronavirus   first isolated from three people with  pneumonia  connected to the cluster of acute  respiratory illness  cases in  Wuhan   
 all features of the novel  SARS-CoV-2   virus  occur in related coronaviruses in nature  
 outside the human body  the  virus  is killed by household soap  which bursts its protective bubbleSARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original  SARS-CoV   
 the  lungs  are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the  virus  accesses host cells via the enzyme ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING enzyme 2  ACE2   which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the  lungs   
 the  virus  uses a special  surface  glycoprotein called a  spike   peplomer  to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell  
 acute cardiac injury was found in 12  of  infected  people admitted in hospital in  Wuhan   China  and is more frequent in severe disease  
 rates of cardiovascular  symptoms  is high  owing to the systemic inflammatory response and  immune system  disorders during disease progression  but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart  
 ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function  
 a high incidence of thrombosis  31   and venous thromboembolism  25   have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19  infections  and may be related to poor prognosisAutopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage  DAD   and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung  
 although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the  respiratory  tract  patients with severe COVID-19 have  symptoms  of systemic hyperinflammation  
 in particular  pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung  pathology  in COVID-19 patients  
 lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy  
 the  WHO  has published several testing protocols for the disease  
 the standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  rRT-PCR   
 the test is typically done on  respiratory  samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal  swab   however  a nasal  swab  or  sputum  sample may also be used  
 results are generally available within a few hours to two days  
 blood tests can be used  but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value  
 Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the  Coronavirus  and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction  PCR  tests to detect  infection  by the  virus   
 as of 4 April 2020  antibody tests  which may detect active  infections  and whether a person had been  infected  in the past  were in development  but not yet widely used  
 the Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70   
 the FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that monthDiagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of  Wuhan  University suggested methods for detecting  infections  based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk  
 bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral  asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early  infection   
 Subpleural dominance  crazy paving  lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling   and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses  
 few data are available about microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19  
 the main pathological findings at autopsy are  
 Macroscopy  pleurisy  pericarditis  lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema 
 four types of severity of  viral pneumonia  can be observed  
 mild  pneumonia   pulmonary oedema  pneumocyte hyperplasia  large atypical pneumocytes  interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation 
 severe  pneumonia   diffuse alveolar damage  DAD  with diffuse alveolar exudates  
 dad is the cause of  acute respiratory distress syndrome    ARDS   and severe hypoxemia  
 healing  pneumonia   organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis 
 blood  disseminated intravascular coagulation  DIC   leukoerythroblastic reaction 
 preventive measures to reduce the chances of  infection  include staying at home  avoiding crowded places  washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds  practising  good respiratory hygiene  and avoiding  touching  the eyes  nose or mouth with unwashed hands  
 the  CDC  recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when  coughing  or  sneezing  and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available  
 proper hand  hygiene  after any  cough  or  sneeze  is encouraged  
 the  CDC  has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public settings  in part to limit  transmission  by  asymptomatic  individualsSocial distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of  infected  persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces  restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings  
 distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet  18 m  apart  
 there is no medication known to be effective at preventing COVID-19As a  vaccine  is not expected until 2021 at the earliest  a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease the  epidemic peak   known as  flattening the curve   
 the  CDC  also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds  especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty  before eating and after blowing one 's nose   coughing  or  sneezing   
 it further recommends using an  alcohol-based  hand sanitiser with at least 60  alcohol  but only when soap and water are not readily availableFor areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available  the  WHO  provides two formulations for local production  
 in these formulations  the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or  isopropanol   
  hydrogen peroxide  is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol  it is  not an active substance for hand antisepsis   
 glycerol is added as a humectant  
 people are managed with supportive care  which may include fluid therapy  oxygen support  and supporting other affected vital organs  
 the  CDC  recommends that those who suspect they carry the  virus  wear a simple  face mask   
 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ECMO  has been used to address the issue of  respiratory  failure  but its benefits are still under consideration  
 personal  hygiene  and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve  immunity   
 supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild  symptoms  at the early stage of infectionThe  WHO  and Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID-19  
 Intensivists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource  the IBCC  
 as of April 2020  there is no specific treatment for COVID-19  
 for  symptoms   some medical professionals recommend paracetamol  acetaminophen  over ibuprofen for first-line use  
  precautions  must be taken to minimise the risk of  virus transmission   especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols  such as  intubation  or hand  ventilation   
 for  healthcare professionals  caring for people with COVID-19  the  CDC  recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room  AIIR  in addition to using standard  precautions   contact  precautions  and airborne precautionsThe  CDC  outlines the guidelines for the use of  personal protective equipment   PPE  during the  pandemic   
 the recommended gear is  PPE gown   respirator  or facemask   eye protection   and medical glovesWhen available  respirators  instead of facemasks  are preferred  
 N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has authorised the  masks  for use under an Emergency Use Authorisation  EUA   
 they are designed to protect from airborne particles like dust but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label uses  
 when  masks  are not available  the  CDC  recommends using face shields or  as a last resort  homemade  masks   
 most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require  mechanical ventilation  or alternatives  but a percentage of cases are  
 the type of  respiratory  support for individuals with COVID-19 related  respiratory  failure is being actively studied for people in hospital  with some evidence that  intubation  can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or BI-level positive airway pressure  
 whether either of these two leads to the same benefit for people who are critically ill is not known  
 some doctors prefer staying with invasive  mechanical ventilation  when available because this technique limits the  spread  of aerosol particles compared to a high flow nasal cannulaSevere cases are most common in older adults  those older than 60 years  and especially those older than 80 years   
 many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita  which limits a health system 's capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalisation  
 one study in China found 5  were admitted to intensive care units  23  needed mechanical support of ventilation  and 14  died  
 in China  approximately 30  of people in hospital with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to ICU  
  mechanical ventilation  becomes more complex as  acute respiratory distress syndrome    ARDS   develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult  
  ventilators  capable of pressure control modes and high peep are needed to maximise oxygen delivery while minimising the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax  
 high peep may not be available on older  ventilators   
 research into potential treatments started in January 2020  and several  antiviral drugs  are in  clinical trials   
 Remdesivir appears to be the most promising  
 although new medications may take until 2021 to develop  several of the medications being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing  
 antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe disease  
 the  WHO  recommended volunteers take part in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatmentsThe FDA has granted temporary authorisation to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person 's life is seriously or immediately threatened  
 it has not undergone the clinical studies needed to show it is safe and effective for the disease  
 in February 2020  China launched a mobile app to deal with the  disease outbreak   
 users are asked to enter their name and ID number  
 the app is able to detect ' close contact ' using surveillance data and therefore a potential risk of  infection   
 every user can also check the status of three other users  
 if a potential risk is detected  the app not only recommends  self-quarantine   it also alerts local health officialsBig data analytics on cellphone data  facial recognition technology  mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track  infected  people and people whom they contacted in South Korea  Taiwan and Singapore  
 in March 2020  the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people supposed to have  Coronavirus   
 the measure was taken to enforce  quarantine  and protect those who may come into contact with  infected  citizens  
 also in March 2020  Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency  Robert Koch Institute  in order to research and prevent the  spread  of the  virus   
 Russia deployed facial recognition technology to detect  quarantine  breakers  
 Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he has been informed by mobile phone operators that  40  of people are continuing to move around anyway   
 German government conducted a 48 hours weekend Hackathon with more than 42000 participants  
 also the president of Estonia  Kersti Kaljulaid  made a global call for creative solutions against the  spread of Coronavirus   
 individuals may experience distress from  quarantine    travel restrictions   side effects of treatment or fear of the  infection  itself  
 BBC quoted Rory O 'Connor in saying   Increased  social isolation   loneliness  health anxiety  stress and an economic downturn are a perfect storm to harm people 's mental health and wellbeing   
 the disease may take a mild course with few or no  symptoms   resembling other common upper  respiratory diseases  such as the  common cold   
 mild cases typically recover within two weeks  while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover  
 pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe  infection  with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses  like  SARS  and MERS  but data for COVID-19 is lackingIn some people  COVID-19 may affect the  lungs  causing  pneumonia   
 in those most severely affected  COVID-19 may rapidly progress to  acute respiratory distress syndrome    ARDS   causing  respiratory  failure   septic shock  or  multi-organ failure   
 complications associated with COVID-19 include  sepsis   abnormal clotting and damage to the heart  kidneys and liver  
 clotting abnormalities  specifically an increase in prothrombin time  have been described in 6  of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19  while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4  of this group  
 approximately 20-30  of people who present with COVID-19 demonstrate elevated liver enzymes  transaminases   
 according to the same report  the median time between  onset  of  symptoms  and death was ten days  with five being spent hospitalised  
 however  patients transferred to an ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalisation and death  
 in a study of early cases  the median time from exhibiting initial  symptoms  to death was 14 days  with a full range of six to 41 days  
 in a study by the National Health Commission  NHC  of China  men had a  death rate  of 28  while women had a  death rate  of 17   
 histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both  lungs   
 viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes  
 the lung picture resembled  acute respiratory distress syndrome    ARDS    
 in 118  of the  deaths  reported by the National Health Commission of China  heart damage was noted by elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest  
 according to March data from the United States  89  of those hospitalised had preexisting conditionsAvailability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region may also affect mortality  
 estimates of the mortality from the condition vary because of those regional differences  but also because of methodological difficulties  
 the under-counting of mild cases can cause the  mortality rate  to be overestimated  
 however  the fact that  deaths  are the result of cases contracted in the past can mean the current mortality rate is underestimated  
 smokers were 14 times more likely to have severe  symptoms  of COVID-19 and approximately 24 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokersConcerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease  
 the Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20  to 30  in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease  and lung scans suggested organ damage  
 this may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery  
 as of March 2020  it was unknown if past  infection  provides effective and long-term  immunity  in people who recover from the disease  
  immunity  is seen as likely  based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses  but cases in which recovery from COVID-19 have been followed by  positive tests  for  Coronavirus  at a later date have been reported  
 these cases are believed to be worsening of a lingering  infection  rather than re-infection  
 the  virus  is thought to be natural and have an animal origin  through spillover  infection   
 the actual origin is unknown  but by December 2019 the  spread  of  infection  was almost entirely driven by human-to-human  transmission   
 a study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19  published in January 2020 in The Lancet  revealed the earliest date of  onset  of  symptoms  as 1 December 2019  
 official publications from the  WHO  reported the earliest onset of  symptoms  as 8 December 2019  
 several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality  
 these numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing  healthcare system quality  treatment options  time since initial  outbreak  and population characteristics such as age  sex and overall health  
 in late 2019   WHO  assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U071 for  deaths  from lab-confirmed  SARS-CoV-2   infection  and U072 for  deaths  from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without lab-confirmed  SARS-CoV-2  infectionThe death-to-case ratio reflects the number of  deaths  divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval  
 based on Johns Hopkins University statistics  the global death-to-case ratio is 69   153822  2240191  as of 17 April 2020  
 the number varies by regionOther measures include the  case fatality rate   CFR   which reflects the percent of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease  and the infection fatality rate  IFR   which reflects the percent of  infected  individuals  diagnosed and undiagnosed  who die from a disease  
 these statistics are not time bound and follow a specific population from  infection  through case resolution  
 while not all  infected  people develop antibodies  the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people have been  infected   
 in the epicentre of the  outbreak  in Italy  Castiglione d 'Adda  a small village of 4600  80  17   are already dead  
 in Gangelt  the disease was  spread  by Carnival festivals  and spread to younger people  causing a relatively lower mortality  and not all COVID-19  deaths  may have been formally classified as such  
 furthermore  the German health system has not been overwhelmed  
 in the Netherlands  about 3  may have antibodies  as assessed from blood donors  
 69  0004  of the population  have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19  
 the impact of the  pandemic  and its  mortality rate  are different for men and women  
 mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy  
 the highest risk for men is in their 50s  with the gap between men and women closing only at 90  
 in China  the  death rate  was 28 percent for men and 17 percent for women  
 the exact reasons for this sex-difference is not known  but genetic and behavioural factors could be a reason  
 sex-based immunological differences  lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men  
 in Europe  57  of the  infected  individuals were men and 72  of those died with COVID-19 were men  
 as of April 2020  the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19  infections   
 research has shown that viral  illnesses  like  Ebola    HIV    influenza  and  SARS  affect men and women differently  
 a higher percentage of health workers  particularly nurses  are women  and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the  virus   
 the  World Health Organization  announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be  COVID-19   
 who chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona  VI for  virus   D for disease  and 19 for when the  outbreak  was first identified  31 December 2019  
 the name had been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location  eg China   animal species or group of people  in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatisationThe  virus  that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute  respiratory syndrome   Coronavirus  2   SARS-CoV-2    
 the  WHO  additionally uses  the  COVID-19 virus   and  the  virus  responsible for COVID-19  in public communications  
 both the disease and  virus  are commonly referred to as   Coronavirus    
 during the initial  outbreak  in  Wuhan   China  the  virus  and disease were commonly referred to as   Coronavirus   and   Wuhan   Coronavirus    
 in January 2020   WHO  recommended 2019-nCov and  2019-nCoV   acute respiratory disease  as interim names for the  virus  and disease in accordance with 2015 guidance against using locations in disease and  virus  names  
 the official names COVID-19 and  SARS-CoV-2  were issued on 11 February 2020  
 due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains  some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts  
 in one example  when an Italian hospital urgently required a  ventilator  valve  and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required  a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight  
 after the initial  outbreak  of COVID-19  conspiracy theories  misinformation and disinformation emerged regarding the origin  scale  prevention  treatment and other aspects of the disease and rapidly spread online  
 humans appear to be capable of spreading the  virus  to some other animals  
 the study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs  ducks  and chickens  
 no medications or  vaccine  is approved to treat the disease  
 international research on  vaccines  and  medicines  in COVID-19 are underway by government organisations  academic groups and industry researchers  
 in March  the  World Health Organization  initiated the  SOLIDARITY Trial  to assess treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy  
 there is no available  vaccine   but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates  
 previous work on  SARS-CoV  is being utilised because  SARS-CoV  and  SARS-CoV-2  both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells  
 there are three vaccination strategies being investigated  
 first  researchers aim to build a whole  virus   vaccine   
 the use of such a  virus   be it inactive or dead  aims to elicit a prompt immune response of the human body to a new  infection  with COVID-19  
 a second strategy  subunit  vaccines   aims to create a  vaccine  that Sensitises the  immune system  to certain subunits of the  virus   
 in the case of  SARS-CoV-2   such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the  virus  intrude the ACE2 enzyme receptor  
 a third strategy is that of the nucleic acid  vaccines   DNA or  RNA  vaccines  a novel technique for creating a vaccination   
 experimental  vaccines  from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacyOn 16 March 2020  the first  clinical trial  of a  vaccine  started with four volunteers in Seattle  
 the  vaccine  contains a harmless genetic code copied from the  virus  that causes the diseaseAntibody dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for  vaccine  development for SARS-COV-2  but this is controversial  
 there are more than 300 active  clinical trials  underway as of April 2020  
 seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria  including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine  
 repurposed  antiviral drugs  make up most of the Chinese research  with nine phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of April  
 a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19  vaccine  and drug candidates was in place  as of April 2020Several existing antiviral medications are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19  including remdesivir  chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine  lopinavir  ritonavir and lopinavir  ritonavir combined with interferon beta  
 there is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir  as of March 2020  
 clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir  
 phase III  clinical trials  are being conducted in the US  China and ItalyChloroquine  previously used to treat malaria  was studied in China in February 2020  with preliminary results  
 however  there are calls for peer review of the research  
 Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine  
 however  the  Wuhan  Institute of Virology  while recommending a daily dose of one gram  notes that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be lethal  
 on 28 March 2020  the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon  ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19  
 preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit  SARS-CoV-2  in vitro  
 Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2Studies have demonstrated that initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2  TMPRSS2  is essential for entry of  SARS-CoV-2  via interaction with the ACE2 receptor  
 the studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies without further studyOseltamivir does not inhibit  SARS-CoV-2  in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment  
 cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19  
 there is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm propertiesTocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China 's National Health Commission after a small study was completed  
 it is undergoing a phase 2 non randomised test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease  
 combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms  it is meant to counter such developments  which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people  
 the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause  CAR T cell therapy  in 2017  
 to date  there is no randomised  controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS  
 transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the  immune systems  of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation  
 this strategy was tried for  SARS  with inconclusive results  
 viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against  SARS-CoV-2   
 other mechanisms however  such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and  or phagocytosis  may be possible  
 other forms of passive antibody therapy  for example  using manufactured monoclonal antibodies  are in development  
 production of convalescent serum  which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this  virus   could be increased for quicker deployment
