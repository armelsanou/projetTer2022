the interest in the removal of emerging contaminants has increased in the last decade. photocatalytic degradation using p-n heterojunctions could effectively provide the degradation of these type of substances that are persistent in the environment. in this work, the synthesis, characterization, and photocatalytic evaluation of tio<sub>2</sub>-f as well as cuo/tio<sub>2</sub>-f and nio/tio<sub>2</sub>-f composite materials were studied in the photo-assisted degradation of caffeine using uv radiation. the fluorination of titanium dioxide induced changes in some physicochemical properties of the materials, which contributed to a decrease in surface area and bandgap energy as well as an increase in crystallite size as compared to pristine tio<sub>2</sub>. ≡ti-f species were evidenced to be formed, which could favor charge separation processes. a highest segregation of cuo species in comparison with nio on the surface of tio<sub>2</sub>-f could be formed, which could increase defect sites and decrease the band gap. the formation of a heterojunction between the semiconductors was evidenced, responsible for the observed improvements in photocatalytic properties of the composite materials. the photocatalytic tests evidenced an important degradation of caffeine; however, mineralization was incomplete. the stability of the composite materials and their potential use in the photocatalytic treatment of caffeine was evaluated by reuse tests.F-box proteins represent a diverse class of adaptor proteins of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) that play critical roles in the cell cycle, signal transduction, and immune response by removing or modifying cellular regulators. Among closely related organisms of the Caenorhabditis genus, remarkable divergence in F-box gene copy numbers was caused by sizeable species-specific expansion and contraction. Although F-box gene number expansion plays a vital role in shaping genomic diversity, little is known about molecular evolutionary mechanisms responsible for substantial differences in gene number of F-box genes and their functional diversification in Caenorhabditis. Here, we performed a comprehensive evolution and underlying mechanism analysis of F-box genes in five species of Caenorhabditis genus, including C. brenneri, C. briggsae, C. elegans, C. japonica, and C. remanei.,Herein, we identified and characterized 594, 192, 377, 39, 1426 F-box homologs encoding putative F-box proteins in the genome of C. brenneri, C. briggsae, C. elegans, C. japonica, and C. remanei, respectively. Our work suggested that extensive species-specific tandem duplication followed by a small amount of gene loss was the primary mechanism responsible for F-box gene number divergence in Caenorhabditis genus. After F-box gene duplication events occurred, multiple mechanisms have contributed to gene structure divergence, including exon/intron gain/loss, exonization/pseudoexonization, exon/intron boundaries alteration, exon splits, and intron elongation by tandem repeats. Based on high-throughput RNA sequencing data analysis, we proposed that F-box gene functions have diversified by sub-functionalization through highly divergent stage-specific expression patterns in Caenorhabditis species.,Massive species-specific tandem duplications and occasional gene loss drove the rapid evolution of the F-box gene family in Caenorhabditis, leading to complex gene structural variation and diversified functions affecting growth and development within and among Caenorhabditis species. In summary, our findings outline the evolution of F-box genes in the Caenorhabditis genome and lay the foundation for future functional studies.The performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) mainly relies on the microbial community in activated sludge (AS). The food to microorganisms (F/M) ratio is an important operational parameter, the recommended value of which is between 0.2 and 0.5 kg·(kg·d)<sup>-1</sup>. The F/M directly influences microbial growth and metabolism, but how the F/M ratio affects AS microbial networks and the related mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, 63 AS samples with different F/M ratios were analyzed by utilizing a random-matrix-theory based network pipeline. Firstly, all 63 samples were divided into three groups based on their F/M ratios (lower F/M group, normal F/M group, and higher F/M group). The results indicated that the lower F/M decreased microbial diversity and evenness significantly, but the higher F/M had no significant effects on the diversity of the microbial community. All three constructed networks were scale-free, small world, and modular, but network size and complexity were decreased in the lower and higher F/M groups. The network of the normal F/M ratio group was detected with the most nodes, the highest average clustering coefficient, and the shortest geodesic distance. The proportion of positive links was 76.8% when the F/M was within the normal range. On the contrary, 71.1% and 60.0% of positive links were identified when the F/M was below 0.2 and above 0.5 kg·(kg·d)<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, 24 keystones were detected in the normal F/M network, whereas only 4 and 7 keystones were detected in the lower and higher F/M networks. Overall, our results provided clear evidence that the AS microbial community could be more stable and resilient to environmental disturbance when the F/M ratio was between 0.2 and 0.5 kg·(kg·d)<sup>-1</sup>.F-waves, which are an indicator of the excitability of spinal cord anterior horn cells, are characterized by diverse waveforms. However, no analytical method has yet been development that fully reflects the diversity of such waveforms. The present study examined whether or not the change in the amplitude by the additive averaging process reflects the dispersion of the peak.,The average amplitude of each waveform and the decrease in the amplitude after the additive averaging process were determined. The correlation between the decrease in the amplitude and the density of the peak was then examined. The histogram was also used to classify the type of waveform dispersion based on the characteristics of the peak latency.,No correlation was found between the change in the amplitude and the peak density. However, the F-waves obtained from the ulnar nerve of healthy subjects were able to be classified into five types.,The parameters of an F-wave analysis are the rise latency, the amplitude and the persistence, and many reports have examined F-waves based on the changes in these values. The present study explored new parameters focusing on the waveform of F-waves reflecting the motor unit.,The results of this study may help to establish a standard of comparison when using the F wave to evaluate spasticity due to upper motor neuron disorders.Insect epithelial cells contain unique cellular extensions such as bristles, hairs, and scales. In contrast to bristle and hair, which are not divergent in their shape, scale morphology shows high diversity. In our attempt to characterize the role of the insect-specific gene, Spindle-F (spn-F), in mosquito development, we revealed a scale-type specific requirement for the mosquito Aedes aegypti spn-F homologue. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we generated Ae-spn-F mutants and found that Ae-spn-F is an essential gene, but we were able to recover a few adult escapers. These escapers could not fly nor move, and died after 3 to 4 days. We found that in Ae-spn-F mutants, only the tip part of the bristle was affected with bulbous with misoriented ribs. We also show that in Ae-spn-F mutants, only in falcate scales, which are curved with a sharp or narrowly rounded apex, and not in other scale types, the tip region is strongly affected. Our analysis also revealed that in contrast to Drosophila spn-F, which show strong defects in both the actin and microtubule (MT) network in the bristle, the Ae-spn-F gene is required only for MT organization in scales and bristles. In summary, our results reveal that Ae-spn-F is required for shaping tapered epithelial cellular extension structures, namely, the bristle and falcate scales by affecting MT organization.Circular RNA (circRNA) F-circEA-2a and micorRNA (miR)-3940-5p are two non-coding RNAs with critical roles in cancer biology. However, their participation in gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) is unclear. We predicted that miR-3940-5p could bind to F-circEA-2a and speculated that miR-3940-5p may interact with F-circEA-2a to participate in cancer biology. This study was conducted to explore the interaction between F-circEA-2a and miR-3940-5p in GA. F-circEA-2a and miR-3940-5p (mature and premature) levels in GA were detected using RT-qPCR. Their correlations were analyzed by Pearson's correlation coefficient. The role of F-circEA-2a in miR-3940-5p maturation was analyzed using overexpression assay. The direct binding of premature miR-3940-5p to F-circEA-2a was analyzed by RNA-RNA pulldown. Proliferation was analyzed with BrdU assay. We found that F-circEA-2a and premature miR-3940-5p were overexpressed in GA, while mature miR-3940-5p was under-expressed in GA. F-circEA-2a suppressed miR-3940-5p maturation in GA cells. MiR-3940-5p directly bound to F-circEA-2a wild type (-wt), but not mutant (-mut). F-circEA-2a promoted GA cell proliferation and inhibited the role of miR-3940-5p in reducing cell proliferation. Therefore, F-circEA-2a might suppress mature miR-3940-5p formation by sponging premature miR-3940-5p to promote cell proliferation in GA. Our study characterized a novel circRNA regulating miR-3940-5p maturation in GA.The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been well-acknowledged as one of the promising alternatives for hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting system because of the more favorable thermodynamic potential. But the shortage of cost-effective electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and durability restricts its practical development. Herein, the partially amorphous fluorine-decorated nickel iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-F) is constructed via a low-temperature fluoridation method. Our study found that HF acid etching of NiFe LDH precursor resulted in the partially amorphous feature and abundant oxygen vacancies, providing rich reaction sites. Simultaneously, the formation of ionic metal-F bond makes it easier to form high-valence metal oxygen hydroxide active sites. Specifically, the as-prepared NiFe-F-4 electrode demonstrates a superb mass activity of 1290 mA mg<sup>-1</sup> at 1.6 V vs. RHE. Further experiments found that amorphous structure and F decorating decreased the activation energy of UOR from 30.71 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> (crystalline NiFe-F-4) to 20.17 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> (amorphous NiFe-F-4), leading to a rapid dynamic with a small Tafel slope of 31 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, NiFe-F-4 casts remarkable long-term durability for 40 h without performance decay. This work holds great promise to develop advanced electrocatalysts for pollution treatment of urea-rich wastewater and energy-saving H<sub>2</sub> production.Chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid (Cl-PFESAs, trade name F-53B), an alternative to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been widely used as a mist suppressant in the Chinese electroplating industry since the 1970 s. Due to greater restrictions on PFOS globally in recent years, the production and use of F-53B correspondingly increased, consequently causing more emissions into the environment. In China, an increasing number of studies report frequent detection and broad exposure to F-53B in the natural environment, various wildlife and the human body. In human blood, the detection rate of F-53B is almost 80%, accounting for 8.69 to 28% of ∑per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). F-53B is the most biopersistent PFAS in humans to date, with a half-life of 15.3 years. In addition, F-53B displays protein binding affinity and high human placental permeability. Recently, some epidemiological studies have reported the health risks associated with F-53B in humans, including abnormal serum lipid metabolism, vascular dysfunction, endocrine disorders and even adverse birth outcomes. Various in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated the toxicity of F-53B, such as hepatotoxicity, interference effects on the endocrine system, as well as reproductive and developmental toxicity. Our aims are to review studies on human F-53B exposure levels, trends and associated health effects; evaluate the potential toxicity; and predict directions for future research.Advanced reduction by strong reducing hydrated electrons is a promising approach to degrade per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of UV/Iodide system for 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA, F-53B) degradation in aqueous solutions. Results from this work demonstrated that UV irradiation with an addition of 0.3 mM KI resulted in 55.99% degradation of F-53B within 15 min and almost 100% within 2 h. The defluorination efficiency of F-53B in the UV/Iodide system was 2.6 times higher than that in the sole UV system after 2 h of irradiation. The degradation efficiency of F-53B was not significantly affected by air purging. The defluorination efficiency with air bubbling, however, was 14.57% lower than that with nitrogen purging. The photodegradation of F-53B in the UV/Iodide system could be well described by a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Degradation rate constant of F-53B correlated positively with the initial concentration. At 20 μg/L, the pseudo-first-order rate constant was 5.641 × 10<sup>-2</sup> min<sup>-1</sup> and the half-life was 12.29 min. Higher initial concentration also required less energy input to achieve the same degradation efficiency. The detection and identification of degradation intermediates implied that destruction of F-53B started from dechlorination and followed by continuously "flaking off" CF<sub>2</sub> units.F.parviflora Lam. is a plant widely used in traditional medicine systems like Unani, Ayurveda, and folk medicines in Iraq and Turkey. It is known as Shahatraj in Arabic, which is derived from Shahatra and called Shajaratuddam. In the ancient Unani system, it is called Shajaratuddam. The term derived from Sajarat means tree, and Dam means blood since it has a potent blood purifier property.,This review focused on comprehensive, updated information on the F.parviflora Lam. about the traditional uses, phytochemical and pharmacology and provided insights into potential opportunities for future research.,The classical literature of Shahatra for its temperament (Mizaj), medicinal properties and traditional therapeutic uses were gathered from nearly 15 classical Unani books, eight local and foreign books on ethnomedicines and ethnobotany in English. The information of pharmacognosy, phytochemical and pharmacological activities of F.parviflora Lam was collected by browsing the Internet (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley online library, Google Scholar, ResearchGate). The relevant primary sources were probed, analysed, and included in this review. The keywords used to browse were F.parviflora Lam, shahatra, pitpapda, and fine fumitory. Relevant Sources were gathered up to April 2021, and the chemical structures were drawn using Chemsketch software. The species name was checked with http://www.theplantlist.org ("F.parviflora Lam. - The Plant List," n.d.). The materials published in both Urdu and English were included in the review.,F.parviflora Lam was found to possess an excess of bioactive compounds and broad pharmacological properties, including antimicrobial activity, antioxidant activity, antiprotozoal activity, anthelmintic activity, antidiarrheal, antispasmodic and bronchodilator activities, antidiabetic activity, hepatoprotective activity, anticancer activity (cytotoxicity)of nanoparticle, antipruritic activity, dermatological effect, reproductive effect, anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity.,In this review, the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of F.parviflora were reviewed. It showed a broad scope of application, and its benefits had been extended far beyond the initial conventional uses of its parts. It consists of numerous chemical constituents and reported various pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial activity, antioxidant activity, antidiabetic activity, hepatoprotective activity, anticancer activity etc. Though it is widely studied using several in-vitro and in-vivo models and tested clinically for skin diseases, several gaps and research priorities have been identified that need to be addressed in the future, such as active ingredients and their mechanism of action applications in immunomodulation and hepatic diseases.The F-box domain is a conserved structural protein motif that most frequently interacts with the SKP1 protein, the core of the SCFs (SKP1-CULLIN-F-box protein ligase) E3 ubiquitin protein ligases. As part of the SCF complexes, the various F-box proteins recruit substrates for degradation through ubiquitination. In this study, we functionally characterized an F-box gene (MtF-box) identified earlier in a population of Tnt1 retrotransposon-tagged mutants of Medicago truncatula and its Arabidopsis thaliana homolog (AtF-box) using gain- and loss-of-function plants. We highlighted the importance of MtF-box in leaf development of M. truncatula. Protein-protein interaction analyses revealed the 2-isopropylmalate synthase (IPMS) protein as a common interactor partner of MtF-box and AtF-box, being a key enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of the branched-chain amino acid leucine. For further detailed analysis, we focused on AtF-box and its role during the cell division cycle. Based on this work, we suggest a mechanism for the role of the studied F-box gene in regulation of leucine homeostasis, which is important for growth.HLA-F, a nonclassical HLA class I molecule, is required for regulating immune tolerance. In recent years, HLA-F has been found to play a role in a variety of cancers, including glioma (GM). Additionally, high expression of HLA-F predicts the poor overall survival of individuals with GM. However, the functions of HLA-F in GM remain to be further elucidated. In this study, we found that HLA-F expression was elevated in GM tissues. High levels of HLA-F resulted in a high cell proliferation index and predicted GM recurrence. Forced expression of HLA-F promoted the growth of murine C8-D1A cells transplanted in immunodeficient <i>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. In contrast, silencing HLA-F inhibited cell growth <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, targeting HLA-F with an anti-HLA-F antibody suppressed the growth of C8-D1A cells stably expressing HLA-F transplanted in immunodeficient <i>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. In further experiments, we found that forced expression of HLA-F contributed to the aerobic glycolysis phenotype in C8-D1A cells along with an increase in HK2 protein stabilization. Conversely, silencing HK2 by shRNA reduced HLA-F-mediated glycolysis and cell proliferation. Our data indicated that HLA-F promoted cell proliferation via HK2-dependent glycolysis. HLA-F could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of GM.In motor control studies, the F-wave (a recurrent discharge evoked by an axonal antidromic volley) widely used for obtaining information on motoneuron pool behavior. However, such F-wave using is a matter of discussion and still has been not validated experimentally. The aim of the present study was investigation of F-wave properties of single firing motor units (MUs) in healthy humans, the properties, which could give evidence for F-wave origin in motoneuron soma and, therefore, could be used for estimation of a relation between MU firing and motoneuron firing behavior. In total, 91 MUs in five muscles of six healthy subjects, during gentle voluntary contractions, were studied. Peri-stimulus time histograms of single MUs were plotted. None of them revealed statistically significant increasing in MU firing probability at the F-wave latency. Analysis of relationships between characteristics of motoneuron firing behavior (mean firing frequency and target interspike interval duration) and properties of F-waves showed their independence. At the same time, it was found that F-waves were recorded in MUs, whose axons possessed the marked supernormal period in excitability recovery cycle after a discharge. Thus, the present results are in contrast to that which should be expected if the F-wave originated in the motoneuronal soma and could provide evidence for motoneuron firing behavior.The F-box proteins (FBP), substrate recognition subunit of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein complex) E3 ligase, play important roles in the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of the target proteins from several cellular processes. Disorders of F-box protein-mediated proteolysis lead to human malignancies. FBP plays an important role in many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and metastasis, suggesting that it can be associated with tumorigenesis, cancer development and progression. However, the expression and function of FBXO9 (F-box only protein 9) differ in various types of human cancer. Due to the ability to regulate the stability and activity of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, and the physiological functions of many of the F-box proteins remain subtle, further genetic and mechanistic studies will elaborate and help define FBXO9's role. Targeting F-box protein or F-box protein signaling pathways could be an effective strategy for preventing or treating human cancer. This review is presented to summarize the part of FBXO9 in different types of human cancer and its regulation mechanism, and to pave the way to design FBXO9-targeting anticancer therapies.Stripe rust, caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i>, is a major threat to wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) production worldwide. The objective of this study was to determine the virulence of <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> races prevalent in the main wheat growing regions of Kenya, which includes Mt. Kenya, Eastern Kenya, and the Rift Valley (Central, Southern, and Northern Rift). Fifty <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> isolates collected from 1970 to 1992 and from 2009 to 2014 were virulence phenotyped with stripe rust differential sets, and 45 isolates were genotyped with sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers to differentiate the isolates and identify aggressive strains <i>PstS1</i> and <i>PstS2</i>. Virulence corresponding to stripe rust resistance genes <i>Yr1</i>, <i>Yr2</i>, <i>Yr3</i>, <i>Yr6</i>, <i>Yr7</i>, <i>Yr8</i>, <i>Yr9</i>, <i>Yr17</i>, <i>Yr25</i>, and <i>Yr27</i> and the seedling resistance in genotype Avocet S were detected. Ten races were detected in the <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> samples obtained from 1970 to 1992, and three additional races were detected from 2009 to 2014, with a single race being detected in both periods. The SCAR markers detected both <i>Pst1</i> and <i>Pst2</i> strains in the collection. Increasing <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> virulence was found in the Kenyan <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> population, and different <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> race groups were found to dominate different wheat growing regions. Moreover, recent <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> races in East Africa indicated possible migration of some race groups into Kenya from other regions. This study is important in elucidating <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> evolution and virulence diversity and useful in breeding wheat cultivars with effective resistance to stripe rust.Most organic pollutants (POP) are persistent in the environment, accumulate in fatty tissues, and so a transfer through the food chain is probably, thereby causing various health effects. We quantified PCDD/F, PBDD/F, PCB, PBDE, perfluorinated substances, and ADONA in breast milk samples collected in two German federal states and breast milk and blood samples from subjects additionally exposed to PFOA. The median (95th percentile) concentrations were 2.43 (6.58) pgWHO<sub>2005</sub>TEQ/g l.w. for PCDD/F, 2.45 (4.82) pgWHO<sub>2005</sub>TEQ/g l.w. for dioxin-like PCB (dl-PCB), and 0.62 (2.69) pgWHO<sub>2005</sub>TEQ/g l.w. for PBDD/F. The relative contributions of the median values of PCDD/F, dl-PCB, and PBDD/F to the total-TEQ were approximately 41%, 42%, and 11%, respectively. Nondioxin-like PCB (ndl-PCB) concentrations were clearly dominated by the higher chlorinated PCB congeners, with medians of 23.2 ng/g l.w. for PCB 153, 13.9 ng/g l.w. for PCB 138, and 13.0 ng/g l.w. for PCB 180. The sum of the 3 congeners (PCB 138, 153, and 180) were multiplied with 1.64 (total PCB) and showed a median of 82.16 ng/g l.w. and a 95th percentile of 173.3 ng/g l.w. Only PFOA and PFOS could be quantified in 29% and 17% of in total 180 samples with 95th percentiles of 53 ng/l and 33 ng/l, respectively. Milk samples (n = 13) from subjects living on PFOA contaminated sites showed higher levels between 33 and 854 ng/l PFOA (mean: 199 ng/l), whilst PFOS could be quantified only in three samples. The sum of 17 PBDE congeners showed medians (95th percentile) of 1737 pg/g l.w. (22,806 pg/g l.w.), with the highest medians of 422 pg/g l.w. for BDE 209 and 378 pg/g l.w. for BDE 153. Overall, our study confirms the declining contamination level in breast milk during the last decade, but points out the need to further reduce the environmental contamination with persistent substances and subsequently the exposure in childhood.The strength, assistance walking, rise from a chair, climb stairs, and falls (SARC-F) questionnaire is a well-established instrument for screening of sarcopenia and sarcopenia-related functional impairments. As it is based on self-reporting, its use precludes patients who are unable to answer the questionnaire as a consequence of severe acute diseases or cognitive impairment. Therefore, we aimed to validate a proxy-reported version of the SARC-F for both ad-hoc as well as retrospective screening for severe sarcopenia-related functional impairments.,Patients aged ≥60 years completed the SARC-F and performed the short physical performance battery (SPPB) at baseline (T1). Proxies in Cohort A gave a simultaneous assessment of the patients' functional status with the proxy-reported SARC-F at T1 and again, retrospectively, after 3 months (T2). Proxies in Cohort B only completed the SARC-F retrospectively at T2. The questionnaires' performances were assessed through sensitivity/specificity analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. For non-inferiority analyses, results of both the patient-reported and proxy-reported SARC-F were correlated with the SPPB total score as well as the results of the chair-rise test subcategory; the respective correlation coefficients were tested against each other.,One hundred and four patients and 135 proxies participated. Using a SPPB score < 9 points as the reference standard, the proxy-reported SARC-F identified patients at high risk for sarcopenia-related functional impairment with a sensitivity of 0.81 (ad-hoc), 0.88 (retrospective Cohort A), and 0.87 (retrospective Cohort B) as well as a specificity of 0.89 (ad-hoc), 0.78 (retrospective Cohort A), and 0.64 (retrospective Cohort B). Areas under the ROC curves were ≥ 0.9 for the ad-hoc proxy-reported SARC-F and the retrospective proxy-reported SARC-F in both cohorts. The proxy-reported SARC-F showed a non-inferior correlation with the SPPB compared with the patient-reported SARC-F for ad-hoc (P = <0.001) as well as retrospective screening for severe sarcopenia-related functional impairment in both Cohorts A (P = 0.007) and B (P = 0.026).,Proxy-reported SARC-F is a valid instrument for both ad-hoc as well as retrospective screening for sarcopenia-related functional impairment and could become the standard tool for evaluating this risk in older adults with severe acute disease, for example, in patients with quickly evolving haematological conditions.The conventional recording of F waves from the vastus lateralis muscle (VL) may not accurately measure the F-wave amplitude, as the F-wave latency is short and overlaps with the M wave. However, the optimal stimulation site of the femoral nerve for recording M and F waves separately from the VL remains unclear. In this study we aimed to determine the optimal stimulation site of the femoral nerve to record M and F waves separately from the VL.,Stimulating electrodes were placed medial and lateral to the VL (50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% of the distance along a line extending from the proximal to the distal thigh). Each site of the distal thigh was electrically stimulated at random and F waves were recorded from the VL. Each stimulation site was considered to be success if there was no severe pain or discomfort during electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve and no overlap between the recorded M and F waves; otherwise, it was determined as a failure.,Thirteen healthy men participated in the study. F waves were successfully recorded in five participants at the 50% sites, eight participants at the 60% site, and 12 participants at the 70% and 80% sites. In cases of failed F-wave measurement, the participants experienced severe pain or discomfort due to electrical stimulation.,M and F waves could be recorded separately from the VL when the relevant branch of the femoral nerve was stimulated in the distal thigh.Strong main-group Lewis acids such as silylium ions are known to effectively promote heterolytic C(sp<sup>3</sup> )-F bond cleavage. However, carrying out the C(sp<sup>2</sup> )-F bond transformation of vinylic C-F bonds has remained an unmet challenge. Herein, we describe our development of a new and simple strategy for vinylic C-F bond transformation of α-fluorostyrenes with silyl ketene acetals catalyzed by B(C<sub>6</sub> F<sub>5</sub> )<sub>3</sub> under mild conditions. Our theoretical calculations revealed that a stabilized silylium ion, which is generated from silyl ketene acetals by carboboration, cleaves the C-F bond of α-fluorostyrenes. A comparative study of α-chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to α-fluorostyrenes because the strong silicon-fluorine affinity facilitates an intramolecular interaction of silylium ions with fluorine atom to cleave the C-F bond. A broad range of α-fluorostyrenes as well as a range of silyl ketene acetals underwent this C-F bond transformation.In this study we compared the recently developed TSPO tracer [<sup>18</sup>F]F-DPA, with [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 and [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 by performing in vivo PET imaging on the same Alzheimer's disease mouse model APP/PS1-21 (TG) and wild-type (WT) mice with all three radiotracers.,To compare the radiotracer uptake, percentage of injected dose/mL (%ID/mL), standardized uptake value ratios to cerebellum (SUVR<sub>CB</sub>), and voxel-wise analyses were performed.,The peak uptake of [<sup>18</sup>F]F-DPA was higher than 4.3% ID/mL, while [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 reached just over 3% ID/mL, and [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 was over 4% ID/mL in only one brain region in the WT mice. The peak/60-min uptake ratios of [<sup>18</sup>F]F-DPA were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than those of [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 and [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28. The differences in [<sup>18</sup>F]F-DPA SUVR<sub>CB</sub> between WT and TG mice were highly significant (p < 0.001) in the three studied time periods after injection. [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 uptake was significantly higher in TG mice starting in the 20-40-min timeframe and increased thereafter, whereas [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 uptake became significant at 10-20 min (p < 0.05). The voxel-wise analysis confirmed the differences between the radiotracers.,[<sup>18</sup>F]F-DPA displays higher brain uptake, higher TG-to-WT SUVR<sub>CB</sub> ratios, and faster clearance than [<sup>18</sup>F]DPA-714 and [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28, and could prove useful for detecting low levels of inflammation and allow for shorter dynamic PET scans.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have usually poor outcome after chemotherapy and early prediction of therapeutic response would be helpful. [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG-PET/CT acquisitions are often carried out to monitor variation in metabolic activity associated with response to the therapy, despite moderate accuracy and radiation exposure limit its application. The glucoCEST technique relies on the use of unlabelled D-glucose to assess glucose uptake with conventional MRI scanners and is currently under active investigations at clinical level. This work aims at validating the potential of MRI-glucoCEST in monitoring the therapeutic responses in a TNBC tumor murine model.,Breast tumor (4T1)-bearing mice were treated with doxorubicin or dichloroacetate for 1 week. PET/CT with [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG and MRI-glucoCEST were performed at baseline and after 3 cycles of treatment. Metabolic changes measured with [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG-PET and glucoCEST were compared and evaluated with changes in tumor volumes.,Doxorubicin-treated mice showed a significant decrease in tumor growth when compared to the control group. GlucoCEST imaging provided metabolic response after three cycles of treatment. Conversely, no variations were detected in [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG uptake. Dichloroacetate-treated mice did not show any decrease either in tumor volume or in tumor metabolic activity as assessed by both glucoCEST and [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG-PET.,Metabolic changes during doxorubicin treatment can be predicted by glucoCEST imaging that appears more sensitive than [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG-PET in reporting on therapeutic response. These findings support the view that glucoCEST may be a sensitive technique for monitoring metabolic response, but future studies are needed to explore the accuracy of this approach in other tumor types and treatments.<i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> race 4, which is in <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> species complex (FOSC) Clade 2, causes a new Fusarium wilt of celery. We compared <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> race 4 with race 2, which causes Fusarium yellows of celery and is in FOSC Clade 3. Optimal temperatures for celery yield are 16 to 18°C. Soil temperatures in California celery production areas can range up to 26°C, and the maximal rate of hyphal extension of <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> races 2 and 4 in culture are 25 and 28°C, respectively. Here, we compared the effect of temperatures from 16 to 26°C on growth of <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> races 4 and 2 in two celery cultivars: Challenger, which is resistant to <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> race 2 and susceptible to race 4; and Sonora, which is susceptible to both <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> races 2 and 4. Based on linear regressions, as temperature increases, there is an increase in the log of <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> race 4 DNA concentration in celery crowns and in the reduction in plant height. Based on logistic regressions, as temperature increases, the incidence of vascular discoloration increases in celery with either <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> race 2 or 4 infection. In both cultivars, temperatures of 22°C and above resulted in a significantly (α = 0.05) greater concentration of <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> race 4 than race 2 in planta. The concentration of <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> race 2 in crowns in 'Challenger' is temperature-independent and comparatively low; consequently, 'Challenger' is, at least partly, resistant rather than tolerant to <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>apii</i> race 2.We sought to examine the relationship between the SARC-F score and the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score in patients with gastrointestinal diseases (GDs, <i>n</i> = 735, median age = 71 years, and 188 advanced cancer cases). The SARC-F score ≥ 4 (highly suspicious of sarcopenia) was found in 93 cases (12.7%). Mild malnutritional condition was seen in 310 cases (42.2%), moderate in 127 (17.3%) and severe in 27 (3.7%). The median SARC-F scores in categories of normal, mild, moderate and severe malnutritional condition were 0, 0, 1 and 1 (overall <i>p</i> < 0.0001). The percentage of SARC-F score ≥ 4 in categories of normal, mild, moderate and severe malnutritional condition were 4.4%, 12.9%, 26.8% and 25.9% (overall <i>p</i> < 0.0001). The SARC-F score was an independent factor for both the CONUT score ≥ 2 (mild, moderate or severe malnutrition) and ≥5 (moderate or severe malnutrition). In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for the CONUT score ≥ 2, C reactive protein (CRP) had the highest area under the ROC (AUC = 0.70), followed by the SARC-F score (AUC = 0.60). In the ROC analysis for the CONUT score ≥ 5, CRP had the highest AUC (AUC = 0.79), followed by the SARC-F score (AUC = 0.63). In conclusion, the SARC-F score in patients with GDs can reflect malnutritional status.Chlorophyll f is a new type of chlorophyll isolated from cyanobacteria. The absorption and fluorescence characteristics of chlorophyll f permit these oxygenic-photosynthetic organisms to thrive in environments where white light is scarce but far-red light is abundant. To explore the ligand properties of chlorophyll f and its energy transfer profiles we established two different in vitro reconstitution systems. The reconstituted peridinin-chlorophyll f protein complex (chlorophyll f-PCP) showed a stoichiometry ratio of 4:1 between peridinin and chlorophyll f, consistent with the peridinin:chlorophyll a ratio from native PCP complexes. Using emission wavelength at 712 nm, the excitation fluorescence featured a broad peak at 453 nm and a shoulder at 511 nm confirming energy transfer from peridinin to chlorophyll f. In addition, by using a synthetic peptide mimicking the first transmembrane helix of light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins of plants, we report that chlorophyll f, similarly to chlorophyll b, did not interact with the peptide contrarily to chlorophyll a, confirming the accessory role of chlorophyll f in photosystems. The binding of chlorophyll f, even in the presence of chlorophylls a and b, by PCP complexes shows the flexibility of chlorophyll-protein complexes and provides an opportunity for the introduction of new chlorophyll species to extend the photosynthetic spectral range.Unique outcomes have emerged from the redox transmetallation/ protolysis (RTP) reactions of europium metal with [Ag(C<sub>6</sub> F<sub>5</sub> )(py)] (py=pyridine) and pyrazoles (RR'pzH). In pyridine, a solvent not normally used for RTP reactions, the products were mainly Eu<sup>II</sup> complexes, [Eu(RR'pz)<sub>2</sub> (py)<sub>4</sub> ] (RR'pz=3,5-diphenylpyrazolate (Ph<sub>2</sub> pz) 1; 3-(2-thienyl)-5-trifluoromethylpyrazolate (ttfpz) 2; 3-methyl-5-phenylpyrazolate (PhMepz) 3). However, use of 3,5-di-tert-butylpyrazole (tBu<sub>2</sub> pzH) gave trivalent [Eu(tBu<sub>2</sub> pz)<sub>3</sub> (py)<sub>2</sub> ] 4, whereas the bulkier N,N'-bis(2,6-difluorophenyl)formamidine (DFFormH) gave divalent [Eu(DFForm)<sub>2</sub> (py)<sub>3</sub> ] 5. In tetrahydrofuran (thf), the usual solvent for RTP reactions, C-F activation was observed for the first time with [Ag(C<sub>6</sub> F<sub>5</sub> )(py)] in such reactions. Thus trivalent [{Eu<sub>2</sub> (Ph<sub>2</sub> pz)<sub>4</sub> (py)<sub>4</sub> (thf)<sub>2</sub> (μ-F)<sub>2</sub> }{Eu<sub>2</sub> (Ph<sub>2</sub> pz)<sub>4</sub> (py)<sub>2</sub> (thf)<sub>4</sub> (μ-F)<sub>2</sub> }] (6), [Eu<sub>2</sub> (ttfpz)<sub>4</sub> (py)<sub>2</sub> (dme)<sub>2</sub> (μ-F)<sub>2</sub> ] (7), [Eu<sub>2</sub> (tBu<sub>2</sub> pz)<sub>4</sub> (dme)<sub>2</sub> (μ-F)<sub>2</sub> ] (8) were obtained from the appropriate pyrazoles, the last two after crystallization from 1,2-dimethoxyethane (dme). Surprisingly 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (Me<sub>2</sub> pzH) gave the divalent cage [Eu<sub>6</sub> (Me<sub>2</sub> pz)<sub>10</sub> (thf)<sub>6</sub> (μ-F)<sub>2</sub> ] (9). This has a compact ovoid core held together by bridging fluoride, thf, and pyrazolate ligands, the last including the rare μ<sub>4</sub> -1η<sup>5</sup> (N<sub>2</sub> C<sub>3</sub> ): 2η<sup>2</sup> (N,N'): 3κ(N): 4κ(N') pyrazolate binding mode. With the bulky N,N'-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)formamidine (DippFormH), which often favours C-F activation in RTP reactions, neither oxidation to Eu<sup>III</sup> nor C-F activation was observed and [Eu(DippForm)<sub>2</sub> (thf)<sub>2</sub> ] (10) was isolated. By contrast, Eu reacted with Bi(C<sub>6</sub> F<sub>5</sub> )<sub>3</sub> and Ph<sub>2</sub> pzH or tBu<sub>2</sub> pzH in thf without C-F activation, to give [Eu(Ph<sub>2</sub> pz)<sub>2</sub> (thf)<sub>4</sub> ] (11) and [Eu(tBu<sub>2</sub> pz)<sub>3</sub> (thf)<sub>2</sub> ] (12) respectively, the oxidation state outcomes corresponding to that for use of [Ag(C<sub>6</sub> F<sub>5</sub> )(py)] in pyridine.Studies have confirmed that circular RNA (circRNA) has a stable closed structure, which plays an important role in the progression of tumors. Cancers with positive fusion genes can produce associated fusion circRNA (F-cirRNA). However, there are no reports concerning a role for F-circRNA of the echinoderm microtubule associated-protein like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase variant 1 (EML4-ALK1) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our study confirmed the existence of fusion circEA1 (F-circEA1) in NCI-H3122 cells (carrying the EML4-ALK1 gene), F-circEA1 was expressed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Sanger sequencing. CCK8 and transwell assays showed that F-circEA1 was beneficial to cell proliferation, metastasis, and invasion. Overexpression of F-circEA1 can also promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion in A549 and SPCA1 cells (non-small cell lung cancer cell line not carrying the EML4-ALK1 gene). Interference with F-circEA1, induced cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis as determined by flow cytometry, and increased drug sensitivity to crizotinib in H3122 cells. F-circEA1 directly affected the expression of parental gene EML4-ALK1. Further research found that F-circEA1 can affect the downstream signaling pathway of ALK. In vivo, the growth rate of xenogeneic tumors was reduced and the protein expression level of EML4-ALK1 was significantly decreased in transplanted tumors measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) after interference with F-circEA1. In conclusion, F-circEA1 can be considered as a proto-oncogene that regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis by affecting the expression of the parental gene EML4-ALK1 and its ALK downstream signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.To evaluate information provided by residency and fellowship programs to graduates of Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education-accredited doctor of pharmacy programs holding F-1 visas who are seeking postgraduate training opportunities.,A 2-phase review of all US-based postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) residency and fellowship programs was conducted. In phase 1, program eligibility criteria were reviewed from the residency and fellowship directories published by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP). In phase 2, the postgraduate programs' official websites were reviewed for additional information. Each program was evaluated to determine the eligibility of international students with F-1 visa or Optional Practical Training (OPT) status, visa sponsorship and work authorization opportunities, and citizenship requirements. Programs were classified as eligible or noneligible to international students or as not providing sufficient information. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data.,A total of 1,455 ASHP PGY1 programs and 69 fellowship programs were included in our analysis. In phase 1, there were 3 eligible programs accepting applicants with F-1/OPT status and 377 noneligible programs. In phase 2, there were 10 eligible programs accepting applicants with F-1/OPT status or providing H-1B sponsorship and 410 noneligible programs. Over 70% of programs (phase 1, n = 1,075; phase 2, n = 1,035) were classified as providing no information. None of the fellowship programs were classified as eligible in our review.,Most residency and fellowship programs did not provide clear eligibility criteria for students with F-1/OPT status. Only a few programs clearly stated that they would accept applicants with F-1/OPT status or provide visa sponsorship to graduates holding F-1 visas.Results of conventional nerve conduction studies may be within normal limits in early diabetic neuropathy. Previous studies demonstrated that F-wave latency should be used to detect this early neuropathic process. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of lower/upper extremity F latency ratios in detecting the early neuropathy in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain.,44 patients with diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) and 44 control subjects whose both conventional nerve conduction studies and F-wave latencies were within normal limits were included to the study. We compared the nerve conduction parameters and lower/upper extremity (tibial/ulnar) F latency ratios of the groups.,Tibial F latency was significantly prolonged and tibial/ulnar F latency ratio was significantly higher in DNP group. Our results support that F-waves are useful for detecting early diabetic neuropathy and suggest that comparison with a control group will demonstrate a difference even when the individuals' F-wave latencies are within the normal limits. The difference was significant for tibial but not for ulnar F latency values supporting the length dependent involvement. The tibial/ ulnar F-wave latency ratio was significantly higher in the DNP group, suggesting that it might also be useful to detect early neuropathy and to demonstrate that the underlying process was predominant in lower extremity.,Further studies may provide additional information about the utility of this ratio for detecting early neuropathy even when F-wave latencies are within normal limits.Age-related loss in skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength, known as sarcopenia, is a well-known phenomenon of aging and is determined clinically using methods such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, these clinical methods to measure sarcopenia are not practical for population-based studies, and a five-question screening tool known as SARC-F has been validated to screen for sarcopenia.,We investigated the relationship between appendicular skeletal lean mass/height<sup>2</sup> (ALM/HT<sup>2</sup> ) (kg/m<sup>2</sup> ) assessed by DXA and SARC-F in a subset of 1538 (778 men and 760 women) participants in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study after adjustment for race/ethnicity, age, and body mass index (BMI) at the time of DXA measurement. We then investigated the association between SARC-F and mortality among 71 283 (41 757 women and 29 526 men) participants in the MEC, who responded to the five SARC-F questions on a mailed questionnaire as part of the MEC follow-up in 2012-2016.,In women, SARC-F score was significantly inversely associated with ALM/HT<sup>2</sup> after adjusting for race/ethnicity, and age and BMI at DXA (r = -0.167, P < 0.001); the result was similar in men although it did not reach statistical significance (r = -0.056, P = 0.12). Among the 71 000+ MEC participants, SARC-F score ≥ 4, as an indicator of sarcopenia, was higher in women (20.9%) than in men (11.2%) (P < 0.0001) and increased steadily with increasing age (6.3% in <70 vs. 41.3% in 90+ years old) (P < 0.0001). SARC-F score ≥ 4 was highest among Latinos (30.8% in women and 16.1% in men) and lowest in Native Hawaiian women (15.6%) and Japanese American men (8.9%). During an average of 6.8 years of follow-up, compared with men with SARC-F score of 0-1 (indicator of no sarcopenia), men with SARC-F 2-3 (indicator of pre-sarcopenia) and SARC-F ≥ 4 had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.00, 1.77, 3.73, P < 0.001], cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (HR = 1.00, 1.85, 3.98, P < 0.001), and cancer mortality (HR = 1.00, 1.46, 1.96, P < 0.001) after covariate adjustment. Comparable risk association patterns with SARC-F scores were observed in women (all-cause mortality: HR = 1.00, 1.47, 3.10, P < 0.001; CVD mortality: HR = 1.00, 1.59, 3.54, P < 0.001; cancer mortality: HR = 1.00, 1.30, 1.77, P < 0.001). These significant risk patterns between SARC-F and all-cause mortality were found across all sex-race/ethnic groups considered (12 in total).,An indicator of sarcopenia, determined using SARC-F, showed internal validity against DXA and displayed racial/ethnic and sex differences in distribution. SARC-F was associated with all-cause mortality as well as cause-specific mortality.Sarcopenia refers to age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass. SARC-F is a screening tool for sarcopenia with high specificity and relatively good overall diagnostic accuracy but with low sensitivity. This study evaluated the diagnostic utility of SARC-F and its three modified versions (SARC-CalF, SARC-F+AC, and SARC-CalF+AC) for screening sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults.,Diagnostic accuracy study.,We screened sarcopenia of older adults (age ≥ 60 years) in three communities in 2020. The participants' information and anthropometric measurements were collected, respectively.,The updated consensuses of AWGS2019 and the EWGSOP2 were applied as the reference standards. we performed sensitivity/specificity analyses and estimated the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the four scales.,The prevalence of sarcopenia was 26.4% and 12.5% based on the AWGS2019 and EWGSOP2 criteria, respectively. The sensitivities/specificities of SARC-F, SARC-CalF, SARC-F+AC, and SARC-CalF+AC were 12.26%/95.59%, 47.17%/91.53%, 82.08%/68.47%, and 75.47%/83.73%, respectively, using the AWGS2019 criteria. Further, the corresponding AUCs of SARC-F, SARC-CalF, SARC-F+AC, and SARC-CalF+AC were 0.650 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.601-0.697), 0.811 (95% CI: 0.769-0.848), 0.801 (95% CI: 0.759-0.839), and 0.848 (95% CI: 0.809-0.881), respectively. Using the EWGSOP2 criteria, the sensitivities/specificities of SARC-F, SARC-CalF, SARC-F+AC, and SARC-CalF+AC were 20.00%/95.44%, 56.00%/86.61%, 70.00%/81.20%, and 80.00%/74.93%, respectively. The AUCs of SARC-F, SARC-CalF, SARC-F+AC, and SARC-CalF+AC were 0.706 (95% CI: 0.659-0.750), 0.799 (95% CI: 0.756-0.837), 0.815 (95% CI: 0.774-0.852), and 0.834 (95% CI: 0.794-0.869), respectively.,The modified versions of SARC-F+AC and SARC-CalF+AC, which have superior sensitivity, can be used to screen sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. SARC-CalF+AC had the highest overall diagnostic accuracy for screening sarcopenia among community-dwelling older adults.A high score determined by SARC-F, a simple screening questionnaire for sarcopenia, has been reportedly associated with worse medical outcomes. However, information regarding whether high SARC-F scores are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with advanced cancer remains limited. We clarified whether a SARC-F score ≥ 4 predicts poor prognosis in patients with cancer receiving palliative care.,We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with cancer who received palliative care at a university hospital between May 2019 and April 2020. Patient characteristics including age, sex, height, weight, cancer type, serum albumin level, C-reactive protein level, presence of edema, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status (ECOG-PS), SARC-F score, history of anticancer therapy, and clinical outcomes were collected from electronic medical records.,Of 304 patients, 188 had a SARC-F score < 4, and 116 patients had a SARC-F score ≥ 4. The overall survival of patients with a SARC-F score ≥ 4 was 40 days (95% CI 29-47), which was significantly worse than 121 days (95% CI 95-156) for patients with a SARC-F score < 4 (p < 0.001). SARC-F score ≥ 4 (hazard ratio: HR 1.56), edema (HR 1.94), head and neck cancer (HR 0.51), C-reactive protein (HR 1.05), ECOG-PS ≥ 3 (HR 1.47), and radiotherapy (HR 0.52) were associated with overall survival. The ability to climb stairs was a SARC-F sub-item significantly associated with mortality (HR 1.59).,The SARC-F questionnaire is a useful predictor of prognosis for patients with cancer receiving palliative care because a SARC-F ≥ 4 score predicts worse overall survival.This study evaluated the effectiveness of the A.F. Genital System (Liofilchem<sup>®</sup> , Italy) in detecting pathogens compared with multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in men with acute urethritis. Men diagnosed as having acute urethritis between 1 April 2021 and 31 December 2021 were included. Urethral swab samples were obtained for A.F. Genital System and PCR testing in a randomly determined order. The efficacy of the A.F. Genital System was analysed by comparing the results of the two tests. The study included 83 patients (mean age 34.1 ± 11.3 years). A urethritis pathogen was detected in 69 patients (83.1%) by PCR and only 15 patients (18.1%) with the A.F. Genital System. The sensitivity of the A.F. Genital System in detecting acute urethritis pathogens was 21.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.6-32.8), and the specificity was 100% (95% CI: 78.5-100). Its sensitivity was 20% (95% CI: 7.1-45.2) in the diagnosis of gonococcal urethritis and 19.1% (95% CI: 11.2-30.4) in the diagnosis of non-gonococcal urethritis. PCR detected two or more urethritis pathogens in 9 patients (13.0%), while no polymicrobial infection was detected with the A.F. Genital System. Based on the results of multiplex real-time PCR, the A.F. Genital System had very low sensitivity in the detection of pathogens in acute male urethritis. It should be kept in mind that using this test in patients with acute urethritis may result in a high missed diagnosis rate for urethritis pathogens.Motor unit number estimation by F waves (F-MUNE) is an uncommonly used MUNE technique. Our aim in this study was to assess the sensitivity of F-MUNE values elicited with newly developed software in motor neuron diseases.,F waves were recorded by 300 submaximal stimuli from abductor digiti minimi and abductor pollicis brevis muscles of 35 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 18 with previous poliomyelitis, and 20 controls. The software determined the surface motor unit action potentials (sMUAPs) and calculated the F-MUNE values. Compound muscle action potential scans were also recorded to obtain MScanFit.,The sMUAP amplitudes were higher and F-MUNE values were lower in both muscles of the patients when compared with controls. F-MUNE values could distinguish patients from controls. Significant correlations were found between F-MUNE and MScanFit in the patient groups.,The new F-MUNE software offered promising results in revealing motor unit loss caused by motor neuron diseases.There are limited screening tools for sarcopenia in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of the SARC-F (Strength, Assistance in walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs, and Falls) questionnaire as a screening tool for sarcopenia (defined by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia [AWGS2019]) in patients undergoing hemodialysis.,This cross-sectional study enrolled 179 patients (mean age: 66.5 ± 12 years, 58% men) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis 3 times per week at a hemodialysis center in Japan. The SARC-F score, handgrip strength, usual gait speed, sit-to-stand test time, short physical performance battery (SPPB), and appendicular skeletal muscle mass were evaluated. The reliability and validity of the SARC-F were analyzed using receiver-operating characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC), and sensitivity/specificity analyses.,There were 49 (27.4%) patients with sarcopenia. Patients with SARC-F ≥4 (59 patients, 33.0%) had poorer grip strength, lower SPPB score, and slower gait speed than those with SARC-F <4, while the skeletal muscle mass index did not differ significantly between the two groups. The sensitivity and specificity values of the SARC-F for identifying sarcopenia were 42.9% and 70.8%, respectively, while those for identifying severe sarcopenia were 66.7% and 72.3%, respectively. The AUCs of SARC-F were 0.57 for sarcopenia and 0.70 for severe sarcopenia.,The SARC-F alone is an inadequate screening tool for sarcopenia in patients undergoing hemodialysis. It should be used in combination with objective assessment measures, rather than as a first-step screening tool, to diagnose sarcopenia.F-box protein genes have been shown to play vital roles in plant development and stress respones. In Arabidopsis, there are more than 600 F-box proteins, and most of their functions are unclear. The present study shows that the F-box (SKP1-Cullin/CDC53-F-box) gene At5g15710 (Salt and Drought Responsiveness, SDR) is involved in abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis. SDR is expressed in all tissues of Arabidopsis and is upregulated by salt and heat stresses and ABA treatment but downregulated by drought stress. Subcellular localization analysis shows that the SDR protein colocalizes with the nucleus. 35S:AntiSDR plants are hypersensitive to salt stress, but 35S:SDR plants display a salt-tolerant phenotype. Furthermore, 35S:SDR plants are hypersensitive to drought stress, while 35S:AntiSDR plants are significantly more drought tolerant. Overall, our results suggest that SDR is involved in salt and drought stress responses in Arabidopsis.We performed evolution, phylodynamics, and reinfection-related antigenicity analyses of respiratory syncytial virus subgroup A (RSV-A) fusion (F) gene in globally collected strains (1465 strains) using authentic bioinformatics methods. The time-scaled evolutionary tree using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method estimated that a common ancestor of the RSV-A, RSV-B, and bovine-RSV diverged at around 450 years ago, and RSV-A and RSV-B diverged around 250 years ago. Finally, the RSV-A F gene formed eight genotypes (GA1-GA7 and NA1) over the last 80 years. Phylodynamics of RSV-A F gene, including all genotype strains, increased twice in the 1990s and 2010s, while patterns of each RSV-A genotype were different. Phylogenetic distance analysis suggested that the genetic distances of the strains were relatively short (less than 0.05). No positive selection sites were estimated, while many negative selection sites were found. Moreover, the F protein 3D structure mapping and conformational epitope analysis implied that the conformational epitopes did not correspond to the neutralizing antibody binding sites of the F protein. These results suggested that the RSV-A F gene is relatively conserved, and mismatches between conformational epitopes and neutralizing antibody binding sites of the F protein are responsible for the virus reinfection.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between serum MMP9 (Matrix metalloproteinase), TIMP1 (Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) levels and MMP9/TIMP1 ratio and primary sarcopenia in geriatric patients, and compare the diagnostic accuracy of such biomarkers with that of the SARC-F score.,A total of 88 patients aged 65 years and older were assessed in the study. Comorbidities and geriatric syndromes were determined and patients with secondary sarcopenia were excluded. EWGSOP2 criteria were used as diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia and SARC-F questionnaire was used to find individuals at risk for sarcopenia. Serum MMP9 and TIMP1 levels were analyzed by ELISA method.,SARC-F, serum MMP9 and MMP9/TIMP1 ratio were significantly higher in the group with sarcopenia compared to the group without sarcopenia (p = 0.001, p = 0.026 and p = 0.006, respectively). In univariate logistic regression analysis, while SARC-F score and MMP9/TIMP1 ratio were significant, MMP9, TIMP1, age and gender were not. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis of the SARC-F score and the MMP9/TIMP1 ratio, it was determined that both of them were associated with sarcopenia [Odds ratio (OR) 1.447 (95%) confidence interval (CI) 1.170-1.791, p = 0.001; OR 1.127, (95%) CI 1.016-1.249, p = 0.023, respectively]. ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of SARC-F and MMP9/TIMP1 was 0.703 (p = 0.001, %95 CI 0.594-0.812) and 0.670 (p = 0.006, %95 CI 0.557-0.783), respectively.,Although this study supports the use of SARC-F questionnaire in daily practice; if SARC-F can't be applicable, the MMP9/TIMP1 ratio could be an alternative choice to the SARC-F.We sought to elucidate the prognostic impact of the SARC-F score among patients with gastrointestinal advanced malignancies (<i>n</i> = 421). A SARC-F score ≥ 4 was judged to have a strong suspicion for sarcopenia. In patients with ECOG-PS 4 (<i>n</i> = 43), 3 (<i>n</i> = 61), and 0-2 (<i>n</i> = 317), 42 (97.7%), 53 (86.9%) and 8 (2.5%) had the SARC-F score ≥ 4. During the follow-up period, 145 patients (34.4%) died. All deaths were cancer-related. The 1-year cumulative overall survival (OS) rate in patients with SARC-F ≥ 4 (<i>n</i> = 103) and SARC-F < 4 (<i>n</i> = 318) was 33.9% and 61.6% (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis for the OS, total lymphocyte count ≥ 1081/μL (<i>p</i> = 0.0014), the SARC-F score ≥ 4 (<i>p</i> = 0.0096), Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) 1 (<i>p</i> = 0.0147, GPS 0 as a standard), GPS 2 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001, GPS 0 as a standard), ECOG-PS 2 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001, ECOG-PS 0 as a standard), ECOG-PS 3 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001, ECOG-PS 0 as a standard), and ECOG-PS 4 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001, ECOG-PS 0 as a standard) were independent predictors. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis on the prognostic value of the SARC-F score, the sensitivity/specificity was 0.59/0.70, and best cutoff point of the SARC-F score was two. In conclusion, the SARC-F score is useful in patients with gastrointestinal advanced malignancies.Previous studies revealed the oncogenic role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HLA-F-AS1 in colon cancer and breast cancer, while its role in other cancers is unclear. We predicted the direct interaction between HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3, which is a tumor suppressor lncRNA. We then assessed the interaction between HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 in glioblastoma (GBM).,The expression levels of HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 in GBM and paired non-tumor tissues from 60 GBM patients were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Overexpression of HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 was achieved in GBM cells to explore the interaction between them. The direct interaction between them was confirmed by RNA pull-down assay. The roles of HLA-F-AS1 and MEG3 in cell invasion, migration and apoptosis were explored by Transwell assays and cell apoptosis assay.,HLA-F-AS1 was highly expressed, and MEG3 was downregulated in GBM. Overexpression of HLA-F-AS1 reduced the expression levels of MEG3 while overexpression of MEG3 did not alter the expression of HLA-F-AS1. HLA-F-AS1 increased cell migration and invasion, but decreased cell apoptosis. MEG3 played opposite roles and reduced the effects of HLA-F-AS1 on cell behaviors.,HLA-F-AS1 may sponge MEG3 in GBM cells to promote cell invasion and migration, and to suppress cell apoptosis.The electron-rich Pt complex [Pt(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] (IMes: [1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolinylidine]) can be used as precursor for the syntheses of a variety of fluorido ligand containing compounds. The sulfur fluoride SF<sub>4</sub> undergoes a rapid oxidative addition at Pt<sup>0</sup> to yield trans-[Pt(F)(SF<sub>3</sub> )(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ]. A photolytic reaction of SF<sub>6</sub> at [Pt(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] in the presence of IMes gave the fluorido complexes trans-[Pt(F)<sub>2</sub> (IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] and trans-[Pt(F)(SF<sub>3</sub> )(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] along with trans-[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] and trans-[Pt(F)(IMes')(IMes)] (IMes': cyclometalated IMes ligand), the latter being products produced by reaction with adventitious water. trans-[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] and trans-[Pt(F)<sub>2</sub> (IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] were synthesized independently by treatment of [Pt(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] with SOF<sub>2</sub> or XeF<sub>2</sub> . A reaction of [Pt(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] with a HF source gave trans-[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ], and an intermediate bifluorido complex trans-[Pt(H)(FHF)(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] was identified. Compound trans-[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)<sub>2</sub> ] converts in the presence of CsF into trans-[Pt(F)(IMes')(IMes)].The f-ratio method is a new quantitative X-ray microanalysis method developed based on a cold field emission scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive spectroscopy system. The f-ratio is calculated with the characteristic X-ray intensities, and the Monte Carlo simulation is employed to build the theoretical relation between the system composition and the f-ratio. In this study, the f-ratio model is formulated with the elemental concentrations and the f-ratio coefficients. The f-ratio models in the binary S-Fe system and the ternary O-Al-Si system were studied, and the beam energy effects were investigated. The quantitative analyses were performed on the standard pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) and kyanite (Al<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub>) specimens, and the results show that the f-ratio model is able to achieve a satisfying accuracy.<i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> Eriks., the cause of wheat yellow or stripe rust on wheat, undergoes sexual reproduction on barberry, but it is unclear if barberry plays any role in stripe rust epidemics under natural conditions. <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> was isolated from its alternate host barberry (<i>Berberis</i> spp.) and primary host wheat in the vicinity of barberry by inoculation of aeciospores and urediniospores on Mingxian 169 cultivar in Qinghai province of China in 2018. The <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> isolates from barberry and wheat were characterized to virulence patterns by inoculation on 24 differentials bearing <i>Yr</i> gene under control conditions and analyzed using 12 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The occurrence frequency of <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> on barberry was 1.87% by inoculation aecia, collected from barberry on Mingxian 169 of wheat. A close virulence relationship was presented between <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> isolates from both barberry and wheat based on virulence simple matching coefficient and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA). Additionally, the same genetic ancestry, based on structure analysis by STRUCTURE program and genetic relationship analyses using discriminant analysis of principal components and PCoA, was shared between <i>P. striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> isolates from barberry and those from wheat. Together, all the results indicated that the role of barberry in providing aeciospores as an inoculum source causing wheat stripe rust epidemic in Qinghai in spring is of considerable importance.The purpose of this study was to compare the primary staging of F-18 labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitor ([<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI) with that of F-18 labeled fluordesoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG PET/CT) in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LAD).,We prospectively analyzed the images of LAD patients who underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI and [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG PET/CT between May 2020 and August 2021. [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI and [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG uptakes were compared using the paired samples t test, and lesion numbers were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.,Thirty-four LAD patients were evaluated. Patients showed high [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI uptake in primary lesions (SUVmax 12.54 ± 3.77). Both [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI and [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG had 100% detection rates for primary tumors. However, [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI showed higher SUV<sub>max</sub> than [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG in lesions of the lymph nodes, pleura, bones, and other tissues (all P ≤ 0.05). Although the absolute uptake values of [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI in brain lesions were lower than those of [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG (1.56 ± 2.19 vs.7.34 ± 3.54, P < 0.0001), the tumor-to-background (T/B) ratios were significantly higher than those of [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG (9.53 ± 12.07 vs.1.01 ± 0.49, P < 0.0001). Generally, [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI PET/CT could visualize more total lesions than [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG (554 vs.464, P = 0.003), especially in lymph nodes (258 vs.229, P = 0.039), the brain (34 vs.9, P = 0.002), and pleura (56 vs.30, P = 0.041). However, contrast-enhanced brain magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) showed more brain lesions than [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI PET/CT (56 vs.34, P = 0.002). Compared with the [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG-based TNM stage, the [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI-based TNM stage was upgraded in six patients (17.6%).,[<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI PET/CT showed a very high detection rate for primary LAD. In addition, <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI PET/CT demonstrated clearer tumor delineation and more lesions than [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG PET/CT, especially in lymph nodes, the brain, and pleura. Therefore, [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI had an advantage over [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG for primary staging of LAD. However, brain MRI could identify more and smaller lesions than [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FAPI PET/CT.The mammalian brain glucose metabolism is tightly and sensitively regulated. An ischemic brain injury caused by cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) affects cerebral function and presumably also glucose metabolism. The majority of patients who survive CA suffer from cognitive deficits and physical disabilities. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) plays a crucial role in inflammatory response in ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Since deficiency of TLR2 was associated with increased survival after CA-CPR, in this study, glucose metabolism was measured using non-invasive [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG PET-CT imaging before and early after CA-CPR in a mouse model comparing wild-type (WT) and TLR2-deficient (TLR2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. The investigation will evaluate whether FDG-PET could be useful as an additional methodology in assessing prognosis.,Two PET-CT scans using 2-deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-D-glucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG) tracer were carried out to measure dynamic glucose metabolism before and early after CPR. To achieve this, anesthetized and ventilated adult female WT and TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were scanned in PET-CT. After recovery from the baseline scan, the same animals underwent 10-min KCL-induced CA followed by CPR. Approximately 90 min after CA, measurements of [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG uptake for 60 min were started. The [<sup>18</sup>F]F-FDG standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated using PMOD-Software on fused FDG-PET-CT images with the included 3D Mirrione-Mouse-Brain-Atlas.,The absolute SUV<sub>mean</sub> of glucose in the whole brain of WT mice was increased about 25.6% after CA-CPR. In contrast, the absolute glucose SUV in the whole brain of TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice was not significantly different between baseline and measurements post CA-CPR. In comparison, baseline measurements of both mouse strains show a highly significant difference with regard to the absolute glucose SUV in the whole brain. Values of TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice revealed a 34.6% higher glucose uptake.,The altered mouse strains presented a different pattern in glucose uptake under normal and ischemic conditions, whereby the post-ischemic differences in glucose metabolism were associated with the function of key immune factor TLR2. There is evidence for using early FDG-PET-CT as an additional diagnostic tool after resuscitation. Further studies are needed to use PET-CT in predicting neurological outcomes.To prepare Pluronic F-127 composite gel loaded with transforming growth factor β <sub>3</sub> (TGF-β <sub>3</sub>) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and observe its osteogenesis and angiogenesis effects <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>.,BMSCs were isolated from the tibial and femoral bone marrow of New Zealand white rabbits and passaged, and the 3rd generation cells were used for subsequent experiments after identification of osteogenic and adipogenic induction. Pluronic F-127 powder and TGF-β <sub>3</sub> were dissolved in L-DMEM medium to prepare Pluronic F-127 gel, TGF-β <sub>3</sub>+Pluronic F-127 gel, BMSCs+Pluronic F-127 gel, and TGF-β <sub>3</sub>+BMSCs+Pluronic F-127 gel. The 3rd generation of BMSCs were cultured with L-DMEM medium (group A), osteogenic induction medium (group B), osteogenic induction medium containing Pluronic F-127 gel (group C), and osteogenic induction medium containing TGF-β <sub>3</sub>+Pluronic F-127 gel (group D), respectively. After 14 days of culturing, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and Alizarin red staining were used to observe the osteogenesis. In addition, the BMSCs were cultured with L-DMEM medium containing Pluronic F-127 gel (experimental group) and L-DMEM medium (control group) for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days, respectively. And the cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay. Ten New Zealand white rabbits were taken to prepare the maxillary sinus lift models, and Pluronic F-127 gel (group A), TGF-β <sub>3</sub>+Pluronic F-127 gel (group B), BMSCs+Pluronic F-127 gel (group C), and TGF-β <sub>3</sub>+BMSCs+Pluronic F-127 gel (group D) were injected into the bone defects, respectively. On the 8th week, imaging examination and HE staining were used to observe the formation of new bone, immunohistochemical staining was used to observe the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in bone tissue, and Western blot was used to detect the relative expressions of VEGF, oncostatin M (OSM), and BMP-4 proteins in bone tissue.,Osteogenic and adipogenic induction identified the isolated and cultured cells as BMSCs. <i>In vitro</i> staining showed that ALP activity and Alizarin red concentration in group D were significantly higher than those in other groups ( <i>P</i><0.05). MTT assay showed that the absorbency ( <i>A</i>) value of the two groups increased gradually, and there was no significant difference between the groups at each time point ( <i>P</i>>0.05). <i>In vivo</i> experimental imaging examination showed that the bone mineral density and osteogenic continuity of group D were the best, and the proportion of new bone volume was superior to other groups ( <i>P</i><0.05). HE staining showed that compared with other groups, bone trabeculae in group D were dense and arranged regularly, on which a large number of osteoblasts and osteoclasts were distributed, and a large number of new bone formation could be seen. Immunohistochemical staining showed the strong positive expressions of BMP-2 and VEGF in group D ( <i>P</i><0.05); Western blot detection showed that the relative expressions of VEGF, OSM, and BMP-4 proteins in group D were significantly higher than those in other groups ( <i>P</i><0.05).,The BMSCs in Pluronic F-127 composite gel loaded with TGF-β <sub>3</sub> and BMSCs can be induced to differentiate into osteoblasts, and the composite gel has no toxic effect on cells, and has obvious osteogenesis and angiogenesis in the maxillary sinus of rabbits.The current derived models for predicting polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/F) emissions from incineration can only be applied to a specific incinerator due to high deviation or systematic errors. And the models fail to provide quantized guidance for the operation of full-scale municipal solid waste incinerators. To address the problem, explainable Bayesian support vector regression (E-BSVR) has been established to generalized predict and maximumly reduce the PCDD/F emissions. First, forty-two PCDD/F samples were determined from a whole year experiment in a full-scale incinerator. Meanwhile, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene(1,2,4-TrCBz), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, oxynitride, particulate matter, fluoride, and hydrogen chloride were measured, as input features. Second, after box-cox transformation normalization, and hyperparameters tuning, the R-Squared and root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed method are 0.983 and 0.044, exhibiting high accuracy. The high accuracy (R-Squared = 0.992) and generalization are also proven on the dataset with high PCDD/F emissions. Then, the performances of BSVR are compared with kernel ridge regression, multiple linear regression, and unary linear regression, indicating afar smaller RMSE of BSVR. Finally, the optimal operating parameters are calculated through local interpretable model-agnostic explanations and the partial dependence plot. Results indicate that reducing the content of organic chlorine in municipal solid waste and inhibiting the deacon reaction are important methods for reducing PCDD/F emissions. The optimal operating parameters for the maximal reduction of PCDD/F emissions are 1,2,4-TrCBz < 0.098 ug/m<sup>3</sup>, fluoride > 0.452 mg/m<sup>3</sup>. As a whole, the E-BSVR method can be used as a reliable and accurate approach for the prediction and reduction of PCDD/F emissions.Extensive efforts have been made to discover new biofungicides of high efficiency for control of <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> race 4, a catastrophic soilborne phytopathogen causing banana Fusarium wilt worldwide. We confirmed for the first time that aureoverticillactam (YY3) has potent antifungal activity against <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> race 4, with effective dose for 50% inhibition (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 20.80 μg/ml against hyphal growth and 12.62 μg/ml against spore germination. To investigate its mechanism of action, we observed the cellular ultrastructures of <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> race 4 with YY3 treatment and found that YY3 led to cell wall thinning, mitochondrial deformities, apoptotic degradation of the subcellular fractions, and entocyte leakage. Consistent with these variations, increased permeability of cell membrane and mitochondrial membrane also occurred after YY3 treatment. On the enzymatic level, the activity of mitochondrial complex III, as well as the ATP synthase, was significantly suppressed by YY3 at a concentration >12.50 μg/ml. Moreover, YY3 elevated the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level to promote mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Cell apoptosis also occurred as expected. On the transcriptome level, key genes involved in the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway were significantly affected, with the expression level of <i>Plc1</i> increased approximately fourfold. The expression levels of two apoptotic genes, <i>casA1</i> and <i>casA2</i>, were also significantly increased by YY3. Of note, phospholipase C activation was observed with YY3 treatment in <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> race 4. These findings indicate that YY3 exerts its antifungal activity by activating the phospholipase C calcium-dependent ROS signaling pathway, which makes it a promising biofungicide.Service providers are adopting the "F-words" in practice as a strengths-based approach to childhood disability. This study aimed to gain insight into service providers' uses of the "F-words", associated barriers, and knowledge translation strategies needed to support implementation.,Service providers were invited to participate in an interview after completing an online survey on their clinical implementation of the "F-words". Content analysis provided insight into use of the "F-words" and perceived barriers; and to identify knowledge translation strategies to facilitate implementation.,Twenty-one service providers from nine countries participated in interviews. Applications of the "F-words" included its use as a conceptual framework, directly in practice, and in teaching/training. Barriers included conflicting attitudes, insufficient funding, language, and misalignment with organizational/government priorities. To support the adoption of the "F-words", participants recommended knowledge translation strategies including local opinion leaders, linkage and exchange, educational outreach and meetings, and distribution of educational materials.,Understanding uses, barriers to use, and knowledge translation strategies will inform future directions to move the "F-words" into practice. A critical step in bridging the research-to-practice gap and encouraging more widespread adoption requires collaboration with service providers to tailor knowledge translation strategies to fit the local context.Implications for RehabilitationService providers around the world are interested in the ICF-based "F-words" and are adopting them in clinical practice to support a holistic, strengths-based approach to childhood disability.While there is considerable uptake of the "F-words", service providers have experienced barriers including conflicting attitudes of families and colleagues, insufficient funding, lack of translations, and misalignment with organizational and government priorities.To further support implementation and overcome perceived barriers, service providers recommended using four knowledge translation strategies: (i) <i>local opinion leaders</i>; (ii) <i>linkage and exchange</i>; (iii) <i>educational outreach/meetings</i>; and (iv) the <i>distribution of educational materials</i>.Service providers and researchers must partner together to tailor knowledge translation strategies to the local context in order to address the needs and priorities of service providers' specific settings and bridge the gap between research evidence and practice.SARC-F is a screening tool for sarcopenia; however, it has not yet been established whether SARC-F scores predict functional outcomes. Therefore, we herein investigated the relationship between SARC-F scores and functional outcomes in stroke patients. The primary outcome in the present study was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 3 months after stroke. The relationship between SARC-F scores and poor functional outcomes was examined using a logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the applicability of SARC-F scores to the assessment of poor functional outcomes was analyzed based on the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC). Eighty-one out of the 324 patients enrolled in the present study (25%) had poor functional outcomes (mRS ≥ 4). The results of the multivariate analysis revealed a correlation between SARC-F scores (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.05-1.59, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and poor functional outcomes. A cut-off SARC-F score ≥ 4 had low-to-moderate sensitivity (47.4%) and high specificity (87.3%). The present results suggest that the measurement of pre-stroke SARC-F scores is useful for predicting the outcomes of stroke patients.Glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain cancer, is composed of heterogeneous populations of differentiated cells, cancer stem cells and immune cells. Cystatin F, an endogenous inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine peptidases, regulates the function of cytotoxic immune cells. The aim of this study was to determine which type of cells expresses cystatin F in glioblastoma and to determine the role of cystatin F during disease progression.,RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry were used to determine cystatin F mRNA and protein levels in glioblastoma tissue samples. The internalization of cystatin F was analyzed by Western blotting. Enzyme kinetics, real time invasion and calcein release cytotoxicity assays were used to assess the role of internalized cystatin F.,We found that cystatin F was not expressed in non-cancer brain tissues, but that its expression increased with glioma progression. In tumor tissues, extensive staining was observed in cancer stem-like cells and microglia/monocytes, which secrete cystatin F into their microenvironment. In trans activity of cystatin F was confirmed using an in vitro glioblastoma cell model. Internalized cystatin F affected cathepsin L activity in glioblastoma cells and decreased their invasiveness. In addition, we found that cystatin F decreased the susceptibility of glioblastoma cells to the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells.,Our data implicate cystatin F as a mediator of immune suppression in glioblastoma. Increased cystatin F mRNA and protein levels in immune, glioblastoma and glioblastoma stem-like cells or trans internalized cystatin F may have an impact on decreased susceptibility of glioblastoma cells to NK cytotoxicity.
